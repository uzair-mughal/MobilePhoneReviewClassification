vivo V17 Pro -  user opinions and reviews
Its aimeezing !
there is no FM radio in actual unit
I love it
C'mon Vivo, its 2019 going 2020 and youre still using low end and old chipsets. Its time to upgrade your chips to at least a sd712 and above. Stop the media hype and quit spending on expensive commercials and promotions. Look at Realme and Xiaomi, both are doing well in the market and their phone's specs are great!
It should be expandable memory 128GB up to 156GB and has technology to share its power to another phone
How good is the battery life and durability of this phone.?
Wooow!!! This is the best phone i have ever seen. Only the network speed and chipset are a bit low. But its FANTASTIC
Vivo v17 pro camera is outstanding,next Vivo phone if it has the latest snapdragon processor it will outstanding and with better camera and ram and rom.
Vivo v17 pro very expensive. Middle class People can not buy this phone. 25000 i buy this phone 
No Micro SD card, snapdragon is low, and no OIS. Rom is 128 GB only, they should give 256 Rom 
I brought les than a year ago a VIVO XI+ in US, and since thwo months ago it start to shud down by itseld and reboot without any message before and neither after. Time to time WiFi stop to work, it shown is connected but communication to network just dead! To recover need to reboot the phone. The worse phone I haver have. Never VIvo for ever!
This will be my last phone and I will not buy any Vivo phone again, this disappoints and annoys me so much!!!! 
I can't see the FM radio ...
low specs high price typical vivo. dont be surprised if you see this company dissappear in 2 to 3 yrs lmao
No fm radio and SD card slot? Then,  no way.
Where is the FM Radio and Card Slot? Looks like I upgraded to a new phone with downgraded features. Very disapointed.
IP68+?  If it can't survive a tropical downpour, it is useless.
very expensive for this specifications !!! snap 675 !!! 
can't wait to test drive it on the palm of my hands , looks good 
Which one better performance, Vivo V17 Pro or Oppo Reno2 F?
Quite a symmetrical body, smaller chin than others, or is it because of the thicker bezels?
I was about to buy this phone in Ph. Browsed this site for spec. One positive note, which is a must in my case, is the micro SD slot. Upon seeing the device, checked, to my surprise there is no microSD slot.  There is only two sim cards in one slot sim tray. there is no option for microSD card. Sad T_T
Theres no memory card slot
Where is dedicated memory slot in this phone?
Which one better Vivo V17 Pro or Oppo Reno2 F?
Vivo and Oppo phones are piece of crap. Rs 29K and still SD 675 chipset, seriously? Better go for Xiaomi Mi9T or K20 pro.
Gorilla Glass?
Is it water resistant?
Vivo V- Series is built for Camera with medium performance... Vivo Nex - Series is built for Flagship Go Ahead Vivo...The future Smartphone Vivo Fans-
no NFC?
amazing improvement taken best level in vivo company.vivo v17 pro awesome. camara
v17 pro its a damn good camera phone with smoothest user interface ever. type-c charging amazing speed. the next gen phone with 8gb powerful ddr4x ram amazing i love it.
Why Malaysia Vivo V17 pro do not have memory card slot?
No Gorilla Glass 5 protection, No flagship processor for flagship priced smartphone. 
My Mi 9T Pro is too far better on this V17 Pro. Specs, Price and all aspects my Mi 9T Pro overkill this V17 Pro.
Why Malaysia getting inferior camera setup? Only 48+8+2+2 instead of 48+8+13+2.
Anybody knows the release date of v17 pro in Pakistan?
V series is all about camera and nothing else compared to the price it sells the phone for
Man this Vivo V17 Pro has no match to Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro. 
Nice phone. I purchased it on 27th Sept. Nice camera love it.
When is vivo V17 Pro launched in Malaysia?
why Android 9?
No slowmo at least 240fps again? Vivo only focus on front camera on their phones but always in video quality and video features are their worse
too much w8ng 4d release date hr@PHiLs
How many colours
In philippines vivo is preparing for the launch of this phone also many store owner is preparing a large stockrooms for these phone because it will not sale at this price range and end up at stockrooms hahaha
Weird looking, but... All right!
Vivo is still wondering in 2018 with Snapdragon 675 chipset
It doesn't make sense to purchase this phone as you can see it's overpriced but yet overkill by Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro or Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro.
very Beauty Design but poor specifications for this price !!! vivo phones are expensive for value !!! 
The V17 Pro for indonesian market doesn't have NFC, and the 13MP telephoto camera has been replaced with the 2MP macro camera... LoL
IP68+??  It has to survive in heavy tropical rain.  
Snapdragon 675 on 400 Euro price!! Really??
Old processor and high price......Bad phone
why NFC always region dependent?
two color only available midnight ocean glacier ice
redmi k20 pro exclusive sd855+ 380$ all these specs its good for 245$
I expected atleast 256gb rom 8gb ram for a 400euro phone
why you guys put wrong spesc every time for every model? V17 pro has no slots for memory card
Please use higher prossesor in this price range;as what you can see in the Redmi k20 pro and it's also of your same price.
Why is it so thick with such an average battery
Do You Guys Know That Sd675 Is Better Than Sd710orsd712.
Update the proessor.. And update the battery. And update ur them system 
400 Â€  !!! 29900 rupia !!! Snap 675 !!! Fast charging 18 w !!!  Vivo phones are expensive for value !!!
If this has UFS and gorilla glass 6 then I will buy it.
>Micro SD expansion That one part is probably BS. C4ETECH confirmed it has no Micro SD card support: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIHCYHxzbLg 
Don't buy motorized pop up is not good at all .
Worst smartphone.in same price segment xiomi is giving us snapdragon 855so why should we buy this 
Not worth to buy
I am a VIVO fan. The processor is too bad (11nm)?
The processor is very low
super minor upgrade from v15 pro, i loled
I think, it should be 712/730
675.. below RMB 2000 i will buy .
Dual facing cameras? for what? bokeh effects in single cam is enough. 
This flagship is really cool i want to buy this phone it looks awesome 
675 is real
Really no fast charge?? 
what?! Snapdragon 675!!! Really!! so this is the end of the V series
Usb type c??? Finaly on vivo v series...
A Vivo phone with USB Type-C? I guess the end is near
