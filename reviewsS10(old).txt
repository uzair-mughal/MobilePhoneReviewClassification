samsung galaxy s10+
finally i bought my s10+ prism green today  also got some accessories along with it like uag flip case tempered glass with a round cut out at the bottom for finger scan. immediately got a 1392 updated for one 1.1 ui and after that another one for over 1930 mb for android 10. right now its on charging  getting updated really really excited to have it d
hi everyone the s10+ is one hell of a phone. fast reliable simple great.  however in the past month or so i had telephone issues. people couldnt hear me clear they said i sound like im passing trough a tunnel.  after it got updated to android 10 the problem disappeared for a brief period of time. after couple of days i saw that bixby got updated and voila problem appears again. does anyone has the same issue? may be or may be not bixby even tho it seems like it. if i force close it and uninstall updates it works again but only for a short time. i need solution even tho the phone is great i cannot use it as a phone rather than as a computer. 
hi i just waiting to purchase s10+.i have lot of doubts. please help me. 1. if i purchase us version. can i use it on united arab emirates? 2. if i purchase canada version. can i use on united arab emirates? 3. is this dual sim support in us and canada versions?
love the android 10 nd the new ui on my s10 plus...
received android 10 update today in middle east. dark mode is great..
i was torn between note 10  s10 but now im gonna buy the s10+ in couple of days. is it a good move?? i prefer the plus over the regular s10 as i like bigger phones.  it also has bigger battery. im upgrading from the note 8.
really love my newly updated os version 10 of my s10plus sooooo smooth soooo lovely fast. from philippines ota is now available for android 10. download yours!! 
isnt it enough to do a factory reset only? or is it required to do clear partition too??
every call is dropping.  sprint tells me i have good to excellent coverage.  is any one else experiencing this with their new s10 +?
my s+10 just stop being hot totally cool now just about one hour again but for over 36 hours was usually very hot. any one with such experience too?
what i love most is the onehanded mode so so sweet. what should i do to correct the battery draining and hot?
which saves battery better? power mode on or off?
hey guys im having exynos version s10+. great phone. best ive used updated to android 10. battery life around 6hrs screen on time. how about yours? and anyone using the phone without screen protectors? any issues?
i got yesterday android 10 in my s10+ in saudi arabia after almost half day normally its lock after that i cant unlock my phone i had tried many many times then i hard factory reset it v painful for me  i lost  lots of things 
updated mine today. internet stopped working. cannot open the app always crashes even after clearing the cache. hope samsung pushes a fix soon for an essential app to crash after the update is very disappointing..
android 10 seems to be running smoothly. im really liking the extra features in it. so im pleased i updated.  battery seems as good as it was on pie. 
i have had a smg975u1 1tb model for the last 8 months and it has developed a worrying flaw.  at times it will work perfectly fine and then while loading a mobile game gmail or browsing chrome the phone will crash and reboot.  after booting it will still be relatively unstable and it usually takes a hard reboot to get it functioning well again.  it also shows intermittent pixel artifacting appearing as short green or blue bars scattered in a broken line across the screen.  i can only assume this may be indicative of a hardware issue. the phone also tends to restart whenever it is plugged in to charge.  i have tried booting into the dev menu to clear the cache and have also performed a factory reset numerous times.  this phone has not been through any hard falls and its been used in the same car mount as my old note 5 which itself didnt experience any heat related problems from sun exposure.  at this point im turned off by such a pricey phone turning into such a lemon.  im curious if samsung support can do anything for this or if i just need to switch brands to something more reliable.  while id give my old note 5 a solid b any day of the week in terms of reliability this flagship s10+ is at a d and sinking fast.
..the best handset you could ever ask for i mean..big display water resistance massive battery headphone jack wireless charging..theres no better device that could hand all these to you in one go.
updated and feels good
why only in usa radio version????
hopefully they will send update to fix these problems. ive read other ppl are having the same issues and some have more than others. im just giving my personal opinion  with android 10 problems. im glad some users are having no problems. and like me some ppl are. maybe once its smooth out after couple updates  it will solve  these issues.  
just an update from my  last omment about android 10. . im having problems with wife now on my s10 plus. keeps going off and get reminder to try again when im on google or theme store. this update has caused me lots of problems. 
mo popup in whatsapp. not supported on android 10. il miss that feature because i like to see whos sending me a  mgs. now just a sound. 
going back to my s9 plus until i get this fixed at samsung centre on monday.  i asked them to put pie back in it. but they said it depends on what model it is which i forgot to tell him. so im hoping they will do that. my paid themes dont work. arghh!  im so angry at myself for putting this update in which seems ibe causing more problems than enough. now some users might find it works fine on theirs. but definitely  not on mine.

thanks for the android 10 update samsung for s10 plus. but still one ui 2 full of bloatware more unknown permission and still no uninstall option yeah you can uninstall some apps but still no freedom to uninstall some unwanted apps like what huawei ui specially facebook.
anyone recommend this phone? feel like want to purchase the 1tb variant but doesnt know the feedback for this phone. please advice anyone. 
the highlights of the phone feature a 16 mp camera which is typo. its a 12 mp sensor.
please  excuse my language  in my comment. but i like to customize  my phone.  all my paid themes i like. 
just got a notice in theme store that android 10 wont support themes running on android pie. so the designers will have to make new themes. thats pissed me off. ive bought all my themes. now they wont work if i  update. so il not upgrade to android 10 until this is all sorted.
s10+ getting  official  android 10  upgrade on january.. germany and china getting it first.

samsung battery endurance 90h and above
almost �€700 and still no dualsim with dedicated sd card. why?!
in camera photo gps detail location is shown but problem altitude is not shown...........its fine samsung s9 plus is any solution available..........
simply a business phone. i like its flat screen design rather than the curve on edges on other phones. its screen look quite wide but feels fit for a normal or small asian hands. apart from this it feels quite thin in hand and light weight on the pocket and shoulders.. the battery... yes it takes me to the end of the day and i only use internet and gps and maps when on holidays and for those certain occasions a thin flat power bank does the work. no need to carry bulky battery phones in the pocket all year round when you need it only in certain times. 
im really loving this link to windows feature. has anyone else tried it? 
i want this phone free
is this phone exynos version able to handle gamecube emulators?
been using this phone for 2 days now so far really love this awesome phone! the battery last a lot longer than i expected on display fingerprint works perfectly fine. last but not least beautiful phone with a headphone jack!

high quality smart phone...
best smartphone of 2019
just received  an update 129.72 mb .for finger print. even though  i got it bout week ago with october update. but no november patch update yet. 
great phone! amazing camera amazing display fast only thing id try to upgrade is the battery life together with the front "wide" selfie camera  not actually a wide one. 
ive just noticed  after update when i pull notification  panel down  under brightness  it says media and device.  so it must  be something new as i never had it before.  or maybe never  noticed it...
sorry.  forgot  to mention  it was 1st october  patch update. 
just received  and downloaded software update. 284.22mb. improved camera features have been added. also   slow motion  feature has been added  to the front camera.  intelligence  wi  f1.5  auto hotspot feature  has been added.  wi  fi tips feature  has been added. it provides  help tips when something goes wrong with  wifi  connection. media and device  easily controls external devices  connected  to your  smartphone.  improved fingerprint  recognition  algorithm.   did anyone else get  it? 
how fast does this phone charge from 0100?
