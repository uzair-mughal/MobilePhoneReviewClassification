huawei p30 pro
im gonna buy a new phone in couple of days  im torn between the p30 pro which in my country is 596  the s10+ which is for 669 not a big difference though. just wanna know which of these is a better phone overall. thanks.
best smartphone till date moved from s10+ and iphone xs max but p30 outclass both of them in terms of battery camera and overall performance 
i fell in love with this phone...design camera battery
no expandable memory slot on a >500 phone shame
whenever multiple people post about this phones medocrity for a flagship phone the fanboy is silent. when it has toned down he will post again about this phone about being the best.
just a mediocre phone with an overpowered camera bought it  used it 3 months dumped id for the s10 plus
this phone has been a disappointment to me. its not all it was said to be. the camera is actually very poor its a rush job. even the seconday camera is very poor it looks like 5mp looks better than this piece of rubbish. i made a comparison with hauwei y9 and a p20lite these camera look super good than this p30 pro. i am reallyreally upset at the quality of these camera.
anyway i still love p30 pro because of camera battery and premium body. but resolution is a bit sad if compare with my previous note 9 but i feel p30 pro is stronger than note 9. just my experiences!!! 
this earpiece screen really need to fix. i really have difficulty to hear my opponents voice especially in the crowded area even in my office. need huawei to fix on this maybe by software upgrade or else
i have recently switched from oneplus 5 which was already a good one to the p30 pro. one thing i am missing is the ability to quickly switch data from one sim to the other. on the oneplus 5 there was a toggle on the notification dropdown. it was very handy and i used the feature a lot when the signal strength on one card was poor. i am missing this on the huawei. could someone please suggest a way to get a quick toggle even if its on on the notification dropdown. thanks much. 
sot 7 hours and still have 26 battery left. amazing shots as in like being shot by a professional... and i was surprised by how smooth gaming is with this phone. did not even experience heating. love this phone except speaker and curve. 
pro is better than apple
need advice on p30 pro or iphone xr
huawei p30 or huawei p30 pro? help pleasee
i just had mine. and to be honest it seems like p30 pro is slow in recognition of group photo compared to my honor 10. and honor 10 sounds a lot louder. the rest though are awesome. i even use the phone clone and it works like magic. didnt even have to type in wifi password as it carried over my new phone. btw im having difficulty pressing a as it sits near the curve. hate the curve. 
still waiting for the android 10 update for my p30 pro... this sucks!
wondering why people still buying a dead phone?!.
after a 4day use the phone is exceptional. i also use samsung s10 + too. . the battery is a monster at p30 pro. the camera also runs exemplary. as minus the s10 + is weaker in the stabizare 4k filming. the optical sensor destroys the ultra sonic from s10 +. overall it is much more ok as s10 + at much fewer money
hi do not be tired i doubt that p30 pro have ultrasonic or optical finger print sensor i think that have a ultrasonic in them.  thank you for best website i see your website several times a day.
updated yesterday to android 10. but disappointed that there was still no option to customize the always on display feature. 
now that it has 10 all security updates will come trough the play store even if huawei sanctions does not stop google will handle it from here.  
hey guys! i have to ask you something yesterday i compared my p30 pro with a friend of mine and i saw that i dont have that rubber under the back glass that is under the front glass. my friend has it under both front and rear glass! how is this posible? what is this all about?? 
i bought p30 pro recently but front camera very bad.. i compare with nova3i 1 feel nova3i much better than p30 pro selfie camera..i really disappointed. ..
i recently bought the huawei p30 pro. so far i that disappointed by the camera. its not all its cut up to be. i made an actual comparison with a friends huawei y9. the y9 pcs look better than the p30. 
its not top on all aspects but great specs device for the price. problem with your con on this phone is u dont even know what youre talking about nor experiencing it. i have no objection if the accusation are right. but as of now keep it going kiddo. u doing a good job spreading hate comments here.
no gorilla glass 5 curve screen really need that  poor huawei 
my huawei p30 pro switch off every 3 to 4 hours time since i brought but when its working its good. to avoid incoming calls better keep another phone with duplicate sim.
huawei has been caught multiple times passing dslr images as if those were taken with the smartphone. cant trust a company using such dishonest marketing practices
excellent produce..more better than s10+ good job
this phone is a monster if you own a 8256. battery back up is very good and camera is quite sharp even at 5x zoom. personally i am using this after using another top android brand set experience is good and highly recommending. 
emui10 huawei p30 pro when will available in malaysia ?
im gonna go crazy ill buy black  aurora and crystal p30 pros at 256 gb sory for my bad englis im romanian
i realy hope for this phone to have android 11 it would be bad if the us ban ended this phones life with android 10.
i see a lot of comments here about video shooting being badterrible but nothing specific about this matter. what is exactly so bad about it? video is very important for me as i probably take more videos than photos. currently i am using nokia 7 plus and i am looking for an upgrade in the camera department and there is a good deal for this phone. i watched some reviews on youtube but it all looked good.
hi gsmarena team and everyone out there! im looking into getting the huawei p30 pro and surfing the net for its features and accessories etc. but i cant seem to get a clearcut answer as to whether it comes with a factory fitted preinstalled screen protective film? can anyone help me with this? thank you! 
anyone here with an ir blaster that doesnt work? my amber sunrise p30 pros ir blast seems to be sending ir signals when i checked in a dark room but it doesnt wok with any of the devices controlled by my p20 pro which i still have.
best phone ever. better than s10plus and xsmax
what do you think guys? there three options with a bit difference in costs. 1st samsung galaxy note 1010 plus 2ndhuawei p30p30 pro 3rdi phone xs1111 pro which one would you recommend me guys in terms of usage and durability? now i am using the samsung galaxy s9 and i want to upgrade for next 1 or 2 years.
constant problem restart updates on off cannot find router
i tried this phone yesterday.damn.this phone is amazing.no wonder trump ban huawei.
which one is have better camera and performance between huawei p30 pro and google pixel 3xl? i am planning to buy and i am confused about both of this which one should i buy?
hey friends i would like to buy huawei p30 pro. could you pls advise me about it.  quality  supporting  comfortable using !!!!!!!!!
hello does anybody had a problem with battery last week when i charge to 100 it show me 61h left after 2 days when 100 charged show 30h left than its back  to 61h and again to 30h? 
wow. great phone. i love huawei
i bought this last may im happy and satisfied but yesterday after capturing plant and other things my camera keep turning off. i notice that the flashlight is not working and when somebody call me i dont hear any single word from them but they hear me. first time its happen to me ive tried anything drain battery to 0clear cache safe mode and the last step that i dont want to do but i will====factory reset. but unfortunately camera flashlight speaker are still not working. guy help me. 
have both the p30 pro and iphone 11 pro. night photos are still unbeatable on my p30 pro and also the zoom capability which was fantastic and used a lot on safari. the iphone 11 pro has much better video and truer colours and better dynamic range in day light but both have different strengths. i will be keeping both as i will have the best camera experience between the two devices. one for different scenarios. 
hey guys im confused what phone to get must i go hauwei p30 pro or iphone xr ? 
the battery is unbelievable. its charge so fast i really like it. second benefit is the camera. i have never seen or used any phone before capturing pictures and recording videos like this model p30 pro. i have switched my previous phone which is iphone xs to this wonderful device. highly recommended.
very good phone got mine a month ago long battery life very good camera. i recommend it. 
this device is famously known around the world as best or second best camera phone yet i see some people complaining about its camera here.  are these fake reviews? do remember that oled display doesnt show accurate colours like lcd even if the original pic has accurate colours. as for the person comparing its camera with iphone 11  go away. you dont own this phone. im 100 sure. 
this phone is ok but nothing to justify the flagship price tag. the camera is driving me crazy taking unnatural poor quality photos that are no where near my wifes pixel 3a photo quality.  and the pixel 3a was a quarter of the price!
buy a huawei phone they said... itã‚â€™ll be fun they said... iã‚â€™m struggling with internet connection day after day. video... i wonã‚â€™t even comment video sucks and we all know it i knew even before i bought it but i never expected it to be this bad. this is a flagship phone after all... my expectations were low and huawei still managed to disappoint me. the best camera on a smartphone  seems to turn orange color into pink and red color into magenta? why? is the camera messed up or the screen really sucks that bad? selfie camera is not impressive either. and phone has lots of glitches and bugs. maybe thatã‚â€™s a result of bad internet connection or the os has major issues? they refused to give me a refund or another phone because my p30 pro isnã‚â€™t broken. it just... sucks.
so far so good on my huawei p30 pro i had no issues encountered from the day i purchased the unit so its an awesome phone for me9829
i see this phone and its not good display screen  i can see pixels one by one!
we just got this phone and itã‚â€™s a beast love the camera and all the features and battery life is awesome 128526 super pumped to learn everything 
i thought to write an ok review because i dont use my phone for video i only dislike selfies and main camera is awesome but also... yeah i notice that my notifications are late often and i have to try hard to catch some internet like some people before wrote but this phone made me cry today!  i saw comments about screen burn in and i checked mine on gray pic and its burned in and i can see logo of instagram app and some other apps there and i cried... it happens on samsung and iphone and other phones too but my brother still has the s8 and my mom s5 and i checked their phones and they donã‚â€™t have the burn in and i only had my phone for 3 months... as i write this i want to cry again i tried to play burn in fixing videos but it didnt help please how do i fix this???
huawei mate 30 pro at first with android? the us government had blacklisted huawei in midmay citing security concerns. thus american companies  including google and chip suppliers  may do business with huawei only with special permission. the blockade was indeed suspended  currently until midnovember. however google may only continue to provide updates to models already introduced to the market  the mate 30 pro is likely to be considered a new device for which the suspension of the blockade does not apply. since the proprietary operating system harmonyos in the development apparently not far enough  it seems most likely that huawei will put the market launch of the mate 30 pro on the open source version of googles android. no licensing is necessary here.  from 2020 users could expect to switch to huaweis own os. in addition to maps and gmail the google apps also include the download platform play store which provides apps with apps.  huawei already has its own app platform but in europe most users rely on google services. upcoming end of october 2019.
is it true that the moon mode in this phone camera is not the real thing?
went back to using iphone se soon after buying p30 pro. android is unstable lots of glitches selfie camera is sub par and video is a joke. i lost almoust 300ã‚â‚¬ on this phone because it loses value when you use it so i had to sell for less than i paid for initially. stay away of this phone!
there are so main bad comments about the p30 pro and mostly are not correct
i had numerous flagships from galaxy s3 to iphone8 and this was my first huawei and it will most likley be the last. i never ever had such a bad experience with a flagship phone. period. i dont want to be disrespectful but here we have a guy who is either a die hard huawei fan or huawei employee arguing against multiple people having bad experience with their phones. i had a p30 pro and i had a bad experience with this device and i want to warn others to be cautious before making a purchase because its a lot of money! that makes me a troll? this guy also ignores the fact that p30 pros video is pure disaster colours are everything but accurate and samsung hands down has a better selfie camera! i personally did have major connection issues with this phone too. all this makes me question if huawei loosened up on quality control to cut some corners?
whats best p30 pro or mate20 pro..?
easy for user and simple 
camera colours are just weird and video is jittery. it cant stand in game for long because internet keeps breaking. also i can see that upper part of my screen is lighter than lower one. do not watch youtube in vertical on this phone! it extremley suspectible to screen burnin! there are also ghosts of some of my icons. and huawei refused to claim my warranty!
true story one of the first huawei phones ideos lasted 8 years straight without battery problems. huawei phones are notoriously robust and long life. best hardware anywhere available. 
best phone ever! long lasting battery brilliant camera amazing photos awesome design breathing crystal  the wifi and mobile connection work both fine. it beats way ahead the top phones. say the display resolution is not as sharp as samsung s10 s one and that it lacks stereo speakers its a loud speaker anyway but overall i am so glad that i chose p30 pro instead of s10+. i moved from many samsung phones to huawei for the 1st time and im quite satisfied. its worth the money!
corning gorilla glass ? no?
heat issues with my p30 pro are on a whole different level i never experienced anything like this in my entire life! do not buy this phone if you are a gamer! it gets extremley hot one part of the screen gets so hot thay it can literally burn you on touch! i am sometimes afraid to charge it. and sometimes i stop in the middle of game because either my phone is too hot or it starts to lag so bad that i cannot keep playing! this phone is dangerous i am afraid to charge it over night i only charge in daytime now in case that it bursts in flames!
if youre looking to buy a new smartphone  please avoid this one. i wish i looked into reviews before making a purchase. reasons? screen burn in within first 3 months of use which is just outrageous! video performance of a low end smartphone. poor selfie camera performance always in portrait mode it seems. it crashes some apps often. wifi keeps disconnecting and 4g is breaking all the time. only positive thing about this phone is a battery but it does heat a lot during charging.
i own a p30 pro and let me tell you coming from ios this phone is absolute junk. pictures are not very clear at all android is very unstable phone keeps bugging major glitches after verifying on my websites it seems to be a general problem i would highly recommend steering clear of this garbage phone !!! 
ive used this phone for almost half a month 4 days shy of half now and wow photos and videos sure are grainy. sort of wished i didnt buy this now but i cant refund it. ive used this for browsing internet and yt. so maybe i made a mistake. battery last around 10h or so with intensive use and around 15h with light browsing from my estimate of my screen time usage app and smartcare on hiboard. but for some reason it doesnt get back to 15h for 2 day use anymore it is roughly 10h now i dont know if i made a good decision or a bad one but huawei you sort of disappointed me especially coming from a previous iphone user.  ive only been happy with the battery. the camera is slightly better than my iphone but if it went any higher with the zoom it is equally as bad as my iphone. i waiting and researched on this phone for months until i bought it. now i found out it isnt good at what they say it is used for. also with its trade ban i might have slight regret but ill hang on in hopes that someone will create a lineage os in the future. the only joy is that i have more battery than my iphone but i guess i should have bought mate 20x or mate 20 pro since p30 pro isnt that big of a change of battery.
i couldnã‚â€™t imagine myself writing this review about this phone until a while ago. i wanted something different from an iphone and since this is the best camera this was my dream phone. so i even lost all my messages from ios and lots of stuff but i got this phone. anyways phone is a bit too big if your hands are small itã‚â€™s also slippy. camera is great but itã‚â€™s true what they say about the video it has a bad video. i wonã‚â€™t sugar coat it. i would also add comment about selfie camera. itã‚â€™s just not that good and i mostly take selfies. real problem with this phone is signal that keeps breaking and it sometimes gets stuck in some apps. and sometimes itã‚â€™s slow to register my touch so i tap something several times before it actually reacts. these might not seem like big problems to you but to me they certainly are. it was not cheap for an android phone. i donã‚â€™t know it is possible that i had bad luck with this one. i will give samsung a shot next in year or two depending how long iã‚â€™ll put up with this and if they donã‚â€™t impress me iã‚â€™ll be back to apple.
its hard to know which opinions are true from real user review or from someone who is just trolling. or someone just discouraging to buy this phone. or a samsung or apple troll employee. lots of or....
which color would be better 
hi there. i currently have the old flagship samsung galaxy s9+.  bit disappointed  underwhelmed by the front  rear cameras not having a wider angle lens as i had hoped or looking for and especially the quality of the selfie camera. would you think the p30 pro is a good propositionalternative in terms of my issues with the galaxy? any honest and polite suggestions  advice are very much appreciated. 
hey guys            people who has huawei p30 pro how do you find the video camera of this smartphone as compared to others? including the quality of 1080p 3060fps? please i want an honest answer for this! thanks 
best phone ever 128076128077
is this 5g compatible?
mate 20 pro or p30 pro... which one ?
should i wait the mate 30 pro or mate 30 or get this one now  ?
so ive returned my p30 pro and have decided that its smarter to save my money and stick with my current phone for another year or two. ive faced same issues as other gentlemen in the comment section and i simply cannot describe my experience as satisfying. battery drain was just extreme even in idle mode. another issue was connectivity i dont use wifi but it was rather underwhelming when it comes to 4g it was rather difficult to catch signal in area where my current phone doesnt struggle at all. but most aggravating issue was the heat. simply immense heat emitted by this device. like other gentleman stated  you could probably fry an egg on it. i was actually scared that my device will burst into flames while still in my hands. this might sound funny but i had to charge my phone in my bathroom because i have ceramic floor there. ceramic tiles cant catch on fire so it was only way for me to sleep peacefully. all due respect to huawei but i wont buy a huawei product again. once was enough.
only thing ill give to this phone are night shots and battery life. connection quality on this phone is simply pathetic and incredibly frustrating on daily basis. another issue is heat. its not too uncomfortable to hold but when you touch one part of the screen i guess on place where the processor is located  you can literally get burned! im not joking. i bet i could cook on it if it had larger surface! i know its not a gaming phone but loads of cheaper phones handle gaming better and without such heat issues. games simply lag because internet is unstable and i guess thermal throttling plays its role too! it gets pretty hot on the charger too! and this is huawei flagship? camera of the year that cant even make a video right? what a joke! ive contacted huawei authorised service centre to either claim my warranty or get my device replaced and yet they told me that theres nothing wrong with my device!?!?!? i want my money back but unfortunatley i cant get refund... i guess ill sell it to some unlucky soul...
