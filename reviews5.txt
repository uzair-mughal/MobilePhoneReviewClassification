apple iphone 11
i have used one week the results are satisfying but it is rather hot when playing games
good to go ahead. i just started with the apple family with 11 series.
great phone never regret buying. but i have great fear before buying.. because of the bad reviews everywhere heat slow charging low specs high price comments. but after risking it and buying i understand why iphone price is so high.  here is my comment everything look sharp and high contrast even when it is lcd screen.  its battery life is super long only 3101mah as stated in this website last 24hrs usage. standby time is awesome.. i forgot to charge overnight.. the battery still stay the same. gaming is no lag smooth i play for 3hrs until i tired and the battery only drop 45!!. unlocking is soo much better then my old phone fast and easy.  but i hope it does not slow down in the future because my old phone did that even have problem launching the dialer. 
why does it say 120hz for the display?
this iphone doesnt equip with fast charging in the box. so why you need to pay high price for not included of fast charging charger. other android brands are still better.
the screen to body ratio could have been 82 cuz apple just reduced its resolution.
bought iphone 11 few weeks ago after my iphone 7 plus have lost. i love iphone 11. i really can feel the upgrade. face id  nice thing. maybe not very easy to use control panel now  you have to swipe it from upper right corner this is not comfortable. i havent seen good camera like this. battery lasts much longer than 7 plus. i thing i dont like  small screen scratches very easily so you have to be carefull with the screen. overall good apple product with normal price  800 .
my callers cant hear me properly what could be the problem i removed the screen protector and the back cover but still my callers say my voice is breaking
iphone 11. what a disappointment. compared to my 6. bluetooth works sometimes voice mail works sometimes. voice dialing in my car doesnã‚â€™t work constantly says ã‚â€œno entry found. none of these problems were present on my 6  it was pretty flawless. really disappointed in apple this was not ready for market
is there any drastic difference between iphone 11 and iphone xr except for camera ? as the performance seem to be on par and considering price xr seem to have more value for money. can someone please help me choose between the two.
my iphone x has sued for year over  doing very well. but past 3 months i noted it screen is running itself without touching. there is no any issue of on device as always stay in pocket. i contact to apple and told might be screen issue  not software or os. anyone has same as my experience kindly share with me.
how do i make my iphone 11 fast charge? it only has 5w adapter with it.. takes almost 3 hrs to charge.. does buying a wireless charger help me with my dilemma?.. or is there such thing? like fast charging thru wirelessly?
does it have a notification light?
apple=quality and beauty
iphone 11 or s10 exynos?
which phone is better? samsung s10+ iphone 11
ive been using the iphone 11 for 24 days now and updated it in ios13.2.3 version. i have no problem with the camera and the user interface because for me its really great so far. its just that the phone has problems with lte connectivity. is it normal? or it is just because of the bugs that the ios 13 has? at first i thought it was just because of my carrier but my sisters phone with the same carrier has no issues at all. its really frustrating to have the cellular data offon and still not working. even tried to onoff the airplane mode and activate the cellular data again to make it work and sometimes not. its 2019 why are we still having these kinds of issues when these phones are expected to have high caliber performance given its advance hardware and software and most especially its price. i came from android and i never encounter these issues with my 3 years old samsung phone. i switched because i want to experience something new and try the apple ecosystem. its my first iphone and to be honest i am totally dismayed and regreted buying the phone. data connectivity is a basic feature of a smartphone. its should not be an issue given its price.
the battery is not good
i havent been using iphone for almost 6 years . i got iphone 11 recently and must say its the worst phone i have ever had. just wonder when anyone will address the flare issue with the camera? or when you have 2 sets of light in the office   one is coming from the screen  the other one from the ceiling   the camera makes ceiling yelloworange almost . other issue   selfie when you wearing black clothes and you focus on black? again face looks orange with teh quality of the phone for 30 eur... had mi9t before and switching for an iphone was worst decision ever  does anyone else is experiencing cameras issues?
i have the phone. i faced two issues. the touch screen is like china cheap watch i am really surprised. i had iphones before they were not like this they resopd immediately but this it seems screen freeze. the second issue is slow in opening web pages.
its 60hz not 120
how to but it 
was looking at the specs since my sister wasted all her money on this thing. i got a phone that was better in every category except cpu for 400... what a ripoff. 
why are iphones getting heavier than one model?
i am confused which one is better iphon x iphone 11
cmon 699 and no radio? at that price i can buy a car with a radio.
my ultra wide camera is shots grainy pictures is it normal?
does this phone have overheating issues when playing pubg or fortnite for hours? i heard too many complaints about this phone overheating is it true? anybody whos using this phone can confirm this? i want to buy it mainly for gaming
got issue in my iphone 11 wifi.. it will disconnecting when my phone is standby i hate it coz i cannot received my messages 
just bought 1 week ago. upgrade it from iphone 7 to iphone 11. phone is working very smoothly. earphones comes with box not working properly. 
iphone x vs iphone 11. the only thing where iphone x wins is with the display and the 3d touch. and the other performances and camera will be great on iphone 11. iphone 11 has better camera sensors which captures more details. and even the front facing camera has gone to 12mp on iphone 11 from 7mp. i guess you can take a hands on both the devices if possible and choose. cause if you want oled only then you should only go for iphone x.
which smartphone should i get iphone x or iphone 11. im conflicted on which iphone to get as the x has a better display but the 11 has a better camera battery and processor
so nicely built hardware but software is not so efficient..... asked about multi tasking or splitscreen functionality and sometimes i think apple has no idea what that means.... but from their marketing strategy multitasking is equivalent to scrolling sideways and closing active screens when another screen is selected ....... ahahahahaha
iphone xs max or iphone 11??
this is the first phone i have had that the screen has scratched by putting it in my pocket. i have owned several different iphones... waiting for screen protector as they can only be ordered online. definitely requires a screen protector first day.
damn this phone is very heavy with accessories and stuff. i tend to drop it on my face while seeing it lying down. damn heavy.
sooo... 3100mah? wo 10mah...
im planning to buy this phone but i need to know are there any overheating issues while playing heavy games like fortnite 60 fps or pubg mobile for long gaming sessions? 
hi is iphone 11 and 11 pro have same camera front and back ?
can anyone who actually tried the iphone 11 and iphone 11 pro max tell us the real difference between them ?  i want to join the apple family and im hesitant between these two devices. mainly because the pro max is much more expensive. so the real question be like "is it worth it to pay this much extra to buy the pro max or one can settle for the iphone 11 with no regrets ?"

iã‚â€™m a proud user of xs max and now waiting for iphone se 2 pro...
i upgraded from iphone se to iphone11. its amazing and flawless. one who is experiencing ios will have no comments to say.
im just wondering if an unlocked and sim free iphone 11 purchased from usa will work in europe ?
i have an apple iphone 6s 32gb which i bought 3 years ago. though it is running fine on ios 13.2 i would like to upgrade my phone to either iphone 11 or oneplus 7t or the galaxy s10 so that it serves me for the next 3 yrs. which one would you suggest ? my main criteria is good battery life good camera and regular updates.
im considering buying this phone mainly for gaming because of the a13 bionic chip but my concerns are thermal throttling and battery life if i play pubg fortnite at extreme graphics for long periods of time will it throttle? any body using this phone can clarify this? thanks in advance
should i upgrade from iphone x to 11 ?! 
it is worth to watch couple of reviews before buying this.
better with an oled screen less power consumption good phone let down by a mixture of dated tech and shoddy implementation of buggy ios 13 thinking of moving to android devices as these have better up to date tech and superior screens why pay a grand for something thats lacking i am seriously thinking of jumping to another platform???
i didnt use iphone yet but im interested to buy a new one ... is it good to buy iphone 11 ?? which is better ?? 11 or 11 pro max ?? please help me to choose one 
iphone is the king of all smartphones. they created the most advance device using the latest premium parts.  you can see always on the website people refurbish iphones with third party parts. the effect is always subpar lousy. the unknown customer with refurbish iphones tends to know nothing.. and blame apple for locking the features of their phones calling it anticonsumer or anti repair. but fact is you can see the third party parts they are crap and the reason they can sell you cheaply. do not buy refurbish iphone from unknown sources. always always take the blow buy new or refurbish from apple store themselves. 
this bling hatred is just disgursting. no valid arguments only premature asumptions and no rela user experience. keep hating i will keep enjoying this amazing device 
i have the iphone 11 for one week now and can safely say this is the best device i have ever owned. my android main phone is huawei p20 pro which is blazing fast and have never lagged or crashed since day 1 but the iphone is on another level. cannot really tell any difference between the 1080p oled on my huawei and the 720p+ lcd on the iphone. the display is bright vivid and colors are great. the camera on this thing is amazing as well. man those portrait shots ! i have been apple hater for years and decided just to try a new iphone and i am really surprised. so my advice would be if you have never owned an iphone dont blindly follow trend and hate on those devices. sure the price is steep got it for 800 euro here but the quality is just stunning. the battery life is better than that on my p20 pro which is already amazing. the speakers are better too loud clear and rich. i am extremely happy with this device and would highly recommend it to all people looking for a flagship that would not break their bank. dont judge the device only by the spec sheet go to the nearest store and check it out its really worth it !
buy iphone 11 yesterday really nice 
httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v=u20srx6tink  iphone 11 screen look same as pro max wow
hi recently bought iphone 11 128gb product red. this is my first iphone. i switched form samsung s9 plus. i was impressed with performance and battery life. its pretty good. camera is average. display is good. i wil give overall 810 
bought it yesterday .... my first ever iphone... switched from s10 plus.... screen resolution is definitely a factor but overall i am satisfied 
own this phone for a week now i actually dont mind the screen resolution despite i also use an android smartphone with 1080p display of course someone will think that the screen is bad by looking at the numbers. for me it is still looks sharp to my eyes unless i put the screen really close to my face. the battery life is good for a phone with 3000+ mah capacity i can easily makes this a 2 days phone with light gaming and medium daily use power saving mode off and part of it thanks to the less than 1080p lcd display. the performance is really good thanks to that a13 chip quick app install opening an app or switching between apps is a breeze. but the camera is another story the image quality looks so bad on the ultrawide angle shot it is like oil painting when zoom in to see the details the normal wide shot still good. the only problem im facing right now is the esim intermittent ran into signal drop hope this issue can be fix on software update.
the only but that can be put to it is that the new camera application is not that is to say for the photos in 16 9 you must continue using the trick of the video ....
selling a phone with a 2012 screen for this price to fools. i take my hat off to you apple.....
guys i should go for xs max or iphone 11 please update fast!
so this have 720p like xiaomi mi a3?
its best job in world to work for apple innovation and design team what they do in a year time is job that two people can do with no effort in a week. 
these back cameras looks so ugly.

apple will get loss for new logo position  old one was best ever  thanks
