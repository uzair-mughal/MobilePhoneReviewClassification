oppo find x
im facing heating issue while playing games plz give me any solution.
i have purchased oppo find x about a month back. i am facing a lot of issues with the applications. even though battery saver is not on all my applications like whatsapp botim emails etc gets turned off i only receive messagesemails after opening that application again if any one else had faced this issue and got some resolution kindly let me know also the wireless keeps disonnecting.
which one should i get to work in the usa? global model????
finally android 9 update is here!!!  since july 30 2019 color os 6 which upgrades android system to android 9 has been available. if you check for upgrade it shows as youre using the latest version of coloros but there is a line above which says "trial". when you click on it it will take you to another screen which shows two options for upgrade one in chinese one in english and it declined my option for english because the 8gb256gb superflash model i have is chinese version.  after you pick the one you can get you have to enter a phone associated with your oppo id then it will start the upgrading process... be patient because its 2.58gb... good luck. 
does anyone here encounter the same issue with mine.. i think my auto brightness is not working or is not working properly. because when i press off then on the auto adjust brightness. it suddenly goes down .. like the dimmest .. then no matter what my lighting is. it wont adjust unlike the oppo f11 pro and other full screen...
no fingerprint sensor with motorized selfie camera is dead phone issue 
not try to be sarcastic does this phone being planned to update to android 9 coloros 6? oppo currently release a oppo reno 10x zoom series an updated version from this find x but with different pop up camera better equipped with micro sd slot and nfc. then oneplus 7 pro is using the vivo nex s pop up camera design. does this smartphone will still get update? i own an oppo find 7 and the no os update really stop me from buying oppo not even ui update like xiaomi miui. heard that vivo nex s is getting android pie updates.
did you know that oppo has release find x�’s kernel source code. you can install twrp and change the os now.
this is a very amazing phone no matter what people say like its bad cause isnt updated yet to android pie thats stupid from peolpe saying that this phone is a monster on any way makes galaxy look bad on every way probably the weak point of this phone is the camera but thats about it i had it for 3 months and honestly i dont care about galaxy or iphone to you guys stick to the ordinary phone same sh every year one or two updates on galaxys or iphones and you end it up paying more for the same brand.
very disappointed with oppo for very very slow android update its high end product but oppo never care about it. we have to wait till august for update to android pie for find x but oppo update to low product. only one time oppo will never consider you again.
disclaimer this will be a detailed review post.  i bought 45 phones past 2 years to try it along with lg v20 but until oppo find x i didnt see any reasons to replace it. so i will be making a lot of comparison with lg v20 which is still a great flagship in early 2019. there is one thing i can say with full confidence. there will be no other phone will ever look like oppo find x. nobody will ever go with their right mind to replicate or copycat this phone. it is that unique. if you want to buy a phone that looks like oppo find x your only choice is oppo find x. os mine is chinese version so it is stuck in oxygen os oppos own operating system so far based on android 8.1. even though rumors were you would need a chinese phone number to get an oppo id thats true only if youre trying to set your account on your phone. oppo website gives both email and phone number options to create an oppo id. next rumor was if you got oppo id you can download and use a 3rd party launcher yes you can download but you cant use it. at this point i can say i dont understand people who complained about oxygen os. it is a very clean and sort of works like google now launcher. most phones i used my go to launcher had always been microsoft. but with oxygen os i didnt give any second thought. if you swipe all the way from left to write you get to a highly customizable quick menu. also a floating screen also pops out like a side bar menu which is also customizable. toop down swipe gives access to quick toggles which is also highly customizable and also allows 3rd party apps to habiate. so you tell me what those big time reviewers talking about limited customization.  setting menu is extremely clean and everything is where you would think they would be. no repetition of submenus. this tend to be issue with many brands own os. camera entire top slides out to say hello. oppo has always been a leader in selfie camera. if anyone know their phone n1 which also has a motorized camera but one that flips around on the top middle of the phone. for many it still operates after 45 years. so motorized parts lifetime seems promising. while selfies are exquisite they tend to over exxagirate the reality. i have never seen myself this good looking in any other selfie. they look like a magazine front page shot. main camera has quite many modes. expert mode during night is really jaw dropping not the quality but the light. in a almost pitch black environment it can still define certain features within the photo which is mind blowing. in pitch black condition it was shooting red and green light onto my face to make me visible during a video call which i found totally mind blowing. camera has many apps. you can scan a test question and get similarly solved questions photos online. there is a mode that works like google lens but directs you to chinese websites. chinese to english english to chinese photo shot translation i heard is much better than google and any other translator. panoramic shot is best i have seen so far. there is almost no distortion when app does it job patching it together and there is no dots to follow just a steady hand. sound first thing why i had a big issue with many phones when comparing to lg v2o was the sound. it was just a supreme phone. however oppo find x has much better sound than lg v20. it gets louder than lg v20 and built in sound enhancing app really makes difference. all the presets actually fit the song profile. if its a rock song rock preset really makes it sound like rock.  battery simply nothing else comes close to beat oppo in charging speed even it has almost been a year in early 2019. i have 2568gb model which came with supervooc. phone has hit from 0 to 90 fairly in 25 minutes. once i plugged it at 23 battery and messaged to a friend and locked the phone and got response in about 3 minutes when i unlocked the phone  was 39 which made no sense at all. it was not gimmick either because phone is lasting comfortably day and half from about 90 battery the way im using it. lg v20 even didnt make it from sunrise to sunset with full battery.  reputation i have never been asked this many times "what kind of phone is that?" "oppo" "what kinda brand is that?" oppo. im a teacher and kids always ask me this "sir! sir!do that thing with your phone!!!" i guess we all know that thing  huh? haha... motorized camera. and this is not the only trick oppo find x is hiding under its sleeves.  if youre looking for something totally original and doesnt compromise on other things over one trick and its not all about what seems to be obvious oppo find x is a phone for you.
been using this phone for almost 5 months.. everything still works fine. but still no android pie update. really disappointed.
oneplus 6t or xiaomi mi mix 3 or oppo find x ??
design beautiful but lacks of 60 fps recording camera no headphone jack no memory card slot no ip68 battery is low and durability is low makes me just skipped this phone and wait for s10+ 5000mah
oppo launch their products yesterday in london uk. oppo find x is �799 what a crazy price. huawei mate 20 pro is �650  o2 london while samsung galaxy note 9 is less than �799. in india oppo find x 256gb cost �626 no visible outlet in the uk. so oppo wants to rip off brits. note 9 and mate 20 pro are far better than oppo.
will support in india band 40
if availability is not an issue and you can afford it check this phone out in person. put it in your hands examine it careful from all angles in terms of fit and finish the coloring under different lighting conditions and try out various features for a good 30 minutes you will get the rush that you dont get from the latest models of samsung and iphones. 
when the slider is down under normal use you have a full screen glass in the front and a full glass back. pure glass only nothing else on the back. the minimalist to the extreme. it is simply the most beautiful design in the history of smartphones. period. in comparison all iphones look like a piece of shit. 
really beautifull but should be for 200 euro instead of 770 euro for these specs!
the best smartphone of 2018. period.
i hope oppo will think of making a find x mini 
another one good phone without. sd card slot fm radio 3.5 jack very small battery.  oppo next time no buy now. 
i use ok google to unlock the phone instead of face unlock to minimize the cam pop up 
i downloaded app to show hardware info on oppo find x. why does it only shows 6.1mp on front camera?
i downloaded apps to show hardware info why does it shows only 6.1mp front camera?
i hope oppo will make a find x mini like 5.0 inches perfect for grip 
i just got mine and i love it... try my best to minimize the pop up cam.. how about update for pie though 
i just got mine i and im loving it i dont care about the rumors i know my phone so im happy with it.. i have a question though im not sure if there is built in screen protector came with. 
 an absolutely stunning design so it should look like a smartphone in 2018 i hope this design will appear in other brands and even in this mechanized form the good work oppo the most beautiful phone of 2018 and the second beautiful smartphone huawei mate 20 pro
what no fingerprint 
i just found out about this and vivo nex just now. i heard about find x but i thought it was a regular looking phone. i used to think full screen phones will not arrive until 2020. but looks they are already here. well atleast this is and vivo nex is almost. this is amazing!
should i buy or not? 
the phone is good but overpriced better i go for htc samsung or iphone 
i bought oppo find x end of july. i live in a small town at the seaside weve got sand almost everywhere but i never had any problem with the camera slider at all.
oppo find x is about 680 euro in thailand.
actually got most interesting cameradespite not awesome sizeaperture stills see samples in camera test tool. see used iso too it can be even better. wonder about mics recording quality someone?
looks interesting but its selling prices are overwhelming high.
this phone has a rgb led notification?
i personally would prefer to use super vooc on a phone other than the oppo find x.
this is an amazing phone! in love with it. the camera is great and the screen is just beautiful!. i love thr speed of the phone and the way it responds. fast as hell!! the battery life is great and the only issue i can say is that the camera slot sometimes gets the dirt lodged into it so you got to keep it clean. other then that its a beautiful phone. 
is the find x available in the middle east now?
no nfc? future my arse.
it is a awesome  mobile i am using  in india qualcomm snapdragon 845 soc based on 10nm most powerful processor from qualcomm  i bought  it at rs59990 from kolkata massive  storage 256gb storage and 8gb ddr4ram with vocc fast charging  and big battery of 3730 me battery the main features  are motorized hidden cameras awesome  smiled display and excellent 3d facial unlock much faster than i phone x and it doesnt  lagg  due to 8gb ram the phone  is much faster than i phonex  we tested excellent customization makes this phone really beautiful with color os 5.1 both sims supports 4gvolte at a same time.oppo find x is much better than samsung note9 in india  it has got exynos9810 horrible processor us variant  is excellent with snapdragon 845soc processor.
the appo x is good function 
screen to body ratio only 87? i doubt this is true with those thin bezels. all reviews announced 93 screen to body ratio.
is this phone is waterproof?
there is no nfc support 128546
v nice 
i love this phone.its so beautifully
i wonder why this phone�’s front camera has much higher quality 25 mp than the rear camera 16 mp.
oppo find x does not play netflix  amazon prime video in hd it plays only sd one plus 5 5t had the same problem every single phone which was fixed had to be sent backtaken physically to the service centres  whenhow does oppo plan to fix it.??? it cant be done through ota update needs physical recalberation of individual phones vivo nex  pocophone f1  some others also fall in the same class. 
this thing is better than iphone x
please update frequency list.
camera of find x captures so real images and enhance the picture quality must say find x is best 
i want a phone  not a tablet
waterproof? ip67
just tried it. overweight oversized expensive phone. motorized slider is slow with no purpose manual slider like a few years ago would be much easier. regular phone with a camera on top is ten times better...price will be down very soon believe me because every buyer will be selling it after a while...
 it is support otg
no headphone jack  but chage to headphone usb type c
no fm radio no 3.5 jack bye bye oppo find x
hi oppo find x is available in pakistan. i purchased it today. glacier blue color 8256. the phone is amazing but it is really fragile. you have to be very careful while using it. a single drop or dent will destroy its beauty.
all those giving their views about oppo find x are all fake news. they have not bought the phone instead just giving fake rumors. i challenge them to show proof of ownership. the review by jerryrigeverything would anyone or sane person put his mobile phone through that to follow jerryrig you must be insane.
i am curious why that phone is too fragile they mentions gorilla glass 5  seems it is not  so my prefer i am not going to buy the chinese phones  until when they will make more reliable like nokias durable phones
omg..... where is gorilla glass 5. see in bent test it is very fragile. it said its covered gorilla glass five but i dont understand why its not protecting?? what is the use and function of gorilla glass five. 
oppo find x is very fragile made. see bent test in youtube it fails terribly. so i prefer vivo nex s. much better then this this find x. 
a beautiful piece of art but a disappointing build quality. i hope buyers will be cautioned on especially when zach destroyed the phone easily by bending it like a biscuit. 
before buying it.watch jerryrig youtube video first. "oppo find x bend test fail."
i saw all comments then what ever might be i am one of the big fan of oppo so i am gonna to buy new oppo find x and still i am using oppo only.. for long i will use oppo only..i love and trust in oppo blindily. because that much i am satisfied in its services and features what has still available  what gets and what will be... that is oppo.thank you.
this gonna be my new phonebut after jerryrigeverything videos just like yeahnah. no buy.
can oppo find x withstand winter below 0 celcius
xiaomi mi8 is better option in half price with almost same specs.
which phone should i buy oppo find x or samsung galaxy note 8? and reasons for the options. in uk where can this phone be bought for under �680? any customer service in the uk? apple samsung etc have call centers 
this phones has only 401 dpi seriously? then u call it the future flagship? 100 jokes the aperture of main camera shown 2.0 how can this phones make nice shooteven it cant making macro shoot i think. 2.0 type fast charging. honestly iv been waiting for released this device till seeing a full specs and my heart feel so........ by the way thanks for jerryrig showing the bend test of this little phones. now i only keep my samsung s8.
finger print?
you press the button to slide out you put the phone to your face you press the button to slide in one hundred times a day...with fingerprint recognition you just put your finger on the spot when you grab it...
haha jerry would probably lower down the sales of this phone.
pls give dimensions with and without retracted camera
vivo nex is durable but oppo find x is fragile. your durability testermessiah jerryrigeverything tested the find x to be not durable. get the vivo nex if you want a durable body fingerprint scanner and a headphone jack.
sir im from india n im very much intrested  n excited to buy oppo find x but i found some security fails cos of only face detection..mean anyone can unlock my phone when i ll sleeping.....sir plz modified yo oppo find x with an inbuilt screen fingerprint security system....im sure it ll make a large increasement in sale of oppo find x.....cos a user feel safe with that security system.....and some payment app ll not work without fingerprint sensor..we have to put up passwords manually in it...
overall the oppo find x is definitely an outstanding flagship! overall the worlds best!. oppo find x and the vivo nex sa are absolutely and undoubtedly the 2 main role models of 2018. holistically well done and keep it up to them!
so did oppo find x?
finally a phone without the notch. only on android! 
pretty cool with high end specs inc the snapdragon 845 and 8gb ram + lot more however for every single use for face id the phone mech has to operate to pop up the cameras. this could be an issue of wear and tear of both ribbons and mechanism which could be very costly to recover. i prefer chocolate bar phones for their simplicity.
just booked one an awesome phone with no notch . this is called innovation. hats off to oppo
cool but much expensive. 
amazing
this is awesome! this is future! 
wow but without nfc ???
gimmick phone. nor iphone and samsung will follow this. oppo just try to did bezelless when in display tech is not ready yet. its not futureee!!!!!!!!!!!! future is in display!!!!!!!!!!!! i hate all of people said it future. if future like this then no need in screen display just use motoric 
good phone
that was hillarious man... damn !
front look like samsung
not having fingerprint reader is a bit disappointing facial unlock is great but for instance what if we want to check our phone for messages while driving? a tap of a finger is faster than swipping and looking at the camera 
so when i go to the website it shows a much bigger bezel that has the front camera here and i see the picture here that appears to not have any front camera which is correct? are there custom roms for this phone?
and one more thing there ui is such a bad optimized that after 1year 8gb of ram is also looks smaller
does this phone receives software ota?
i wish it could have been thinner than 9.4mm to about 7 point something
is there any plans to release in 5 inch screen size?
where is finger print 
is this a phone name or a math question ?
its saport slow motion
have nfc??
new phone.. buy buy buy!
funky design
over price. 
1000 eur in india?! serioufuckinusly?!!  i wonder for how long an average person have to work to afford such phone over there! sponsored hype in social networks weak specs.  maybe clever design but before buy id wait for more independent tests  reviews.  avoid overhyped stuff its an obvious rush on your wallets!!!
no one will waste 60k for experiment 128514
reasons to get find x luxury design. no notch bezelless. fastest charging speed supervooc for 256 gb version reasons not to get find x not enough reliable brand buyers may be dismissed from supports after a few years most expensive to other common flagship phones. camera is competitive to midend smartphones not hiend. not water resistant. weak mechanism. you can pull up or push down the popup camera easily no headphone jack.
really waste phone except the design. the unlocking process takes exactly 1.5 seconds which may seem less in words but when u want to unlock a phone then its the worst where the slowest fingerprint reading phone unlocks in 0.44 seconds. really over priced for its quality internally having the same annoying shutter sound which u could hear on cheap china mobiles.
hahahahaha oppp n 59k.
its going to launch in india today..by  the way great article..please suggest me some tips for my new site�…  httpswww.gadget360.techmotoe5plus   thanks man!
price is rs.60000
so high price for android device
price should be 600. theyre charging 400 more just for an awkward not so durable lifting mechanism. camera sucks samples surfing through the web are not even at oneplus 6 level and dont get me started with comparing it to the s9+  xperia xz2 premium or google pixel 2xl.
this phone is taking away alot of basic features like no home and back softhard keys and headphone jack oppo find x is gonna make my life complicated like "finding x in math class"
only 1080p resolution? with a display that big i expected at least 1440p. also no 3.5mm jack? everything else seems pretty high end but i wouldnt buy it.
1. no sd card support 2.no wireless charger 3. no headphone jack 4.no water proof 5.no qhd+ display 6.no finger print scener.  this is oppo find pop shi.t
1000 euro..!!! its ok ill buy first change the name oppo to a smart name.... after blackberry you are enter in the smart phone market for sucking peoples money without having any smart phone.
ive been using r7+ > r9 > r9s+ > r11s+ > r15pro like their display camera most importantly battery life and speed of rejuice it. clearly oppo is my cup of tea. but i wonder how does the protector casing would be 129300 waterproof casing needless to say 129296
does the screen of this curve?it looks like the s8 with all screen and with motorize 
1000 eu with oppo with this specifications never never
havent wireless charging
1000 euro really? omg !!!
seriously gys awsome mobile and the camera is in the middle of top 
aahhh time pass mobile nothing else 
oh what a beautiful phone. i want this phone so bad.  if it only had a fingerprint reader under the screen  it would have been epic.  this or samsung galaxy note. 
looks preety cool! i dont know anything about this brand but this find x looks very good. i just would like ip68 to take advantage of the camera under a swimming pool d is this brand officially sold in us?
very good selfie cam facebook cannot use it secretly. but also we need physical switch to switch off microphone and camera because facebook just took patent to use phone microphone to spy on us without asking permission? if its true we need physical switch to switch microphone off.
there is no indication that the phone is water proof or ip certified .any clue?
very good phone and 5 edge
no oppo find x doesnt have on screen fingerprint reader or any other fingerprint reader. check linustechtips or mkbhd on youtube to clear your doubt.
wow kudos to oppo for being bold and brave enough to create such an innovative and interesting phone ! the million dollar question will it end up becoming a huge problem for oppo ? reliability is important and moving parts although exciting and very cool maybe big mistake.
a version lite in 6 inch less expensive would be very appreciated
smartphones are still fragile even with using the current strongest gorilla glass 5. adding moving parts would make it more fragile i think? it might be hard or cant put a shockproof casing on it because of the changing size due to the pop up camera. and waterresistant was out of the question.
these day smartphone  no extra  storage if phone broke reset all data n cloud  storage  limited  hiazzz
back panels design is unique . 3.5mm jack no+card slot no+1000 euro= this phone not for me..
but oppo works well i have mine now for a year and it never fails in terms of playing games and performance. battery life took longer as well. i just dont know why theyre telling that oppos performance is bad among other phone. but base on my experience oppos performance is best than samsung huawei and apple.
paying 1000 euro for a chinese brand is not smatrest thing you can do eventually the phone will fail in a week or so. oppovivononame= no quality
