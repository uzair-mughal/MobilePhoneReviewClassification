samsung galaxy s10+
its not all in megapixels.
sos tupid to add 1tb or 512 gb you cant load all the memory. becasue next year will come s11+ useles memorie. maxim for a phone is 64gb maxim! also 128gb is to much.
12mp again
i bet 12gb ram and 1tb will cost around 2000.  genuinely same phone made by xiaomi with xiaomi sticker on it would cost up to 700. what that means? supporting samsung = supporting den of thieves. 
look nice but dont like the camera on the screen..    so i wait for note 11 next year as note 9 still great phone  
it cant be for them to use again the old 12 mp sensor. by the way the mp race has started to rise again. 12 mp will be considered midend only soon. that 12 gb of ram is insane by the way! 
quick charge 2.0
lets hope that it will be holistically great this time!!!?
isnt it enough to do a factory reset only? or is it required to do clear partition too??
every call is dropping.  sprint tells me i have good to excellent coverage.  is any one else experiencing this with their new s10 +?
my s+10 just stop being hot totally cool now just about one hour again but for over 36 hours was usually very hot. any one with such experience too?
what i love most is the onehanded mode so so sweet. worst my battery is draining fast and phone hot. what should i do to correct the battery draining and hot?
which saves battery better? power mode on or off?
hey guys im having exynos version s10+. great phone. best ive used updated to android 10. battery life around 6hrs screen on time. how about yours? and anyone using the phone without screen protectors? any issues?
i got yesterday android 10 in my s10+ in saudi arabia after almost half day normally its lock after that i cant unlock my phone i had tried many many times then i hard factory reset it v painful for me  i lost  lots of things 
updated mine today. internet stopped working. cannot open the app always crashes even after clearing the cache. hope samsung pushes a fix soon for an essential app to crash after the update is very disappointing..
android 10 seems to be running smoothly. im really liking the extra features in it. so im pleased i updated.  battery seems as good as it was on pie. 
i have had a smg975u1 1tb model for the last 8 months and it has developed a worrying flaw.  at times it will work perfectly fine and then while loading a mobile game gmail or browsing chrome the phone will crash and reboot.  after booting it will still be relatively unstable and it usually takes a hard reboot to get it functioning well again.  it also shows intermittent pixel artifacting appearing as short green or blue bars scattered in a broken line across the screen.  i can only assume this may be indicative of a hardware issue. the phone also tends to restart whenever it is plugged in to charge.  i have tried booting into the dev menu to clear the cache and have also performed a factory reset numerous times.  this phone has not been through any hard falls and its been used in the same car mount as my old note 5 which itself didnt experience any heat related problems from sun exposure.  at this point im turned off by such a pricey phone turning into such a lemon.  im curious if samsung support can do anything for this or if i just need to switch brands to something more reliable.  while id give my old note 5 a solid b any day of the week in terms of reliability this flagship s10+ is at a d and sinking fast.
..the best handset you could ever ask for i mean..big display water resistance massive battery headphone jack wireless charging..theres no better device that could hand all these to you in one go.
updated and feels good
why only in usa radio version????
hopefully they will send update to fix these problems. ive read other ppl are having the same issues and some have more than others. im just giving my personal opinion  with android 10 problems. im glad some users are having no problems. and like me some ppl are. maybe once its smooth out after couple updates  it will solve  these issues.  
just an update from my  last omment about android 10. . im having problems with wife now on my s10 plus. keeps going off and get reminder to try again when im on google or theme store. this update has caused me lots of problems. 
mo popup in whatsapp. not supported on android 10. il miss that feature because i like to see whos sending me a  mgs. now just a sound. 
going back to my s9 plus until i get this fixed at samsung centre on monday.  i asked them to put pie back in it. but they said it depends on what model it is which i forgot to tell him. so im hoping they will do that. my paid themes dont work. arghh!  im so angry at myself for putting this update in which seems ibe causing more problems than enough. now some users might find it works fine on theirs. but definitely  not on mine. 
s10 plus devices getting android 10 update with one ui 2.0
my phone got immersed in water for less than 10 minutes and it went off and now its failing to reboot. what can i do?
can someone who have updated to android  10  please  post a comment about themes working  after update.  thanks. 
has anybody upgraded  to android 10 on this forum?  if there is anyone can you please let us know that everything is working fine? 
anyone who upgraded to android 10? hows the battery life and are there any significant or noticeable performance issues or optimizations?
yea finally 1 got android 10...amazing  thanks a lot samsung...
 i checked in settings for monthly update like i always do and update for android 10 started to download 1979.05 mb. . ive paused it for now. i dont want to upgrade to it yet because themes wont work. anyone else here get it?? 
thanks for the android 10 update samsung for s10 plus. but still one ui 2 full of bloatware more unknown permission and still no uninstall option yeah you can uninstall some apps but still no freedom to uninstall some unwanted apps like what huawei ui specially facebook.
anyone recommend this phone? feel like want to purchase the 1tb variant but doesnt know the feedback for this phone. please advice anyone. 
the highlights of the phone feature a 16 mp camera which is typo. its a 12 mp sensor.
please  excuse my language  in my comment. but i like to customize  my phone.  all my paid themes i like. 
just got a notice in theme store that android 10 wont support themes running on android pie. so the designers will have to make new themes. thats pissed me off. ive bought all my themes. now they wont work if i  update. so il not upgrade to android 10 until this is all sorted.
s10+ getting  official  android 10  upgrade on january.. germany and china getting it first. 
stable android 10 has just released for samsung s10 in germany.
very beautiful phone
samsung battery endurance 90h and above
almost ã‚â‚¬700 and still no dualsim with dedicated sd card. why?!
in camera photo gps detail location is shown but problem altitude is not shown...........its fine samsung s9 plus is any solution available..........
simply a business phone. i like its flat screen design rather than the curve on edges on other phones. its screen look quite wide but feels fit for a normal or small asian hands. apart from this it feels quite thin in hand and light weight on the pocket and shoulders.. the battery... yes it takes me to the end of the day and i only use internet and gps and maps when on holidays and for those certain occasions a thin flat power bank does the work. no need to carry bulky battery phones in the pocket all year round when you need it only in certain times. 
im really loving this link to windows feature. has anyone else tried it? 
i want this phone free
is this phone exynos version able to handle gamecube emulators?
been using this phone for 2 days now so far really love this awesome phone! the battery last a lot longer than i expected on display fingerprint works perfectly fine. last but not least beautiful phone with a headphone jack!
why samsung flagship sseries and noteseries replacing lipo with liion battrey? is that better liion battrey with problem overheat and decreasing capacity over years than lipo batrey?
where can i find the samsung 10plus  user manual that depicts all operating manual
i have put tempered glass on s10 plus. fingerprint isnt good. is any solution. is any other tempered glass in the market in india which fingerprint works fine. pls suggest
anyone having problems with lift to wake or double tap to wake?  
high quality smart phone...
best smartphone of 2019
just received  an update 129.72 mb .for finger print. even though  i got it bout week ago with october update. but no november patch update yet. 
great phone! amazing camera amazing display fast only thing id try to upgrade is the battery life together with the front "wide" selfie camera  not actually a wide one. 
ive just noticed  after update when i pull notification  panel down  under brightness  it says media and device.  so it must  be something new as i never had it before.  or maybe never  noticed it...
sorry.  forgot  to mention  it was 1st october  patch update. 
just received  and downloaded software update. 284.22mb. improved camera features have been added. also   slow motion  feature has been added  to the front camera.  intelligence  wi  f1.5  auto hotspot feature  has been added.  wi  fi tips feature  has been added. it provides  help tips when something goes wrong with  wifi  connection. media and device  easily controls external devices  connected  to your  smartphone.  improved fingerprint  recognition  algorithm.   did anyone else get  it? 
how fast does this phone charge from 0100?
samsung is all good but why samsung use android dont make new opareting system
fp on s10+ update arrived today eastern europe still no one ui update or android 10 update 
i havent received  update  for  fingerprint ?...
im having  problems  with  sending  media through  bluetooth.  this is the  first  its  happened.  i keep having  to restart  my my s10 plus.  also  im  having  the same  problem  with my paid  themes as i did  on s9i plus.  i have  to keep  reinstalling  them  few times  a day.  iv  tried  clearing  cache  and data.  but problem  is still  there.  so  i might  have  to do reset. dont  know  why this  is happening again....
2160p60fps no oiseis  wrong. ois works fine in 4k 60fps. 
anyone confirm if the fingerprint issue fix patch have landed on your samsung s10 plus?
which region can you get the s10 snapdragon version
i really disappointed by s10 plus witi connectivity unable to connect to wifi connection unless comes closer to router pathetic connectivity 
i have been using samsung for a week nowand am very very satisfied. performancephotos and looks.in my opinion is the best smartphone ever.
i regret trading in my s9+ for the s10+ ceramic. the finger print sensor is a million times better on the rear and as a physical unit rather than the crap inside the screen it fails so much. also the fact that they removed the iris scanner but kept face recognition is a joke when the introduction the iris scanner they said it was more secure. so why remove the better and keep the worse. i hate the fact they got rid of the led notification it dosnt sound like a big deal but going from having to without is a major step back. all they have done is made the screen slightly bigger with a very annoying floating camera and removed all the best features of the previous model which would only have made the s10 better.  do not upgrade save your money and stick with the s9 series.  s10 series massive fail
this week i became the 1.october security patchcan someone tell when we got android 10.iam from switzerland btw.
it should have been a good camera phone hn this price range.but the features are very well
samsung s10 plus is the best money exchange...
what is best s10 or plus
please suggest me what should i buy. s10 plus p30 pro
nothing wrong with my speaker.. sound is good and rich.
pros good main camera. decent battery. rich functionality.  cons not reliable very poor sound on speaker glitchy a bit expensive.
greetings would like to ask if any of you tried the uv activated tempered glass protector? my  screen protector got bubles on one side i think because the plastic was bent due to pressure in the pocket with coins i think. is the tempered glass ok and does is affect the fingerprint reader? thanks
just received  1st  october security update 114.16 mb. anyone else got it? 
im starting to have problems in camera.  adter taking some video clips when i go to gallery they are on grey cour and when i press to play it comes up unsported file. i dont have that problem on my s9 plus. anyone else facing this problem?
i just bought the s10+ only to find the fm radio not available. the fm radio is only available for usa and canada buyers what about the rest of us as we pay just as they do why cant we have the fm radio as well. is our money not good enough or are we just not good enough to have the radio. this is not fair. we buy features we can never have access to and only to see that people from other countries who bought the same product have more that you got for the same money. this doesnt add up samsung.
update available in india now. i just updated mine
i started having this problem on my s10+ since last night. when i go to any of my bookmarks like here and anywhere else i get a blank page saying rat the bottom reload or wifi connection down. my wifi is fine and im connected to it. so has anyone else got this problem and what to do to solve it..?
i took the screen protector of my s10+. it was full of bubbles
for this price very poor fingerprint sensor performance speed and accepting the actual fingerprint. i had xiaomi note 6 pro before it had 1.5x speed and was 3 times more accurate when scanning. just disappointing. also a lot of application froze and crashed before. i think some updates fixed but cant say that i wasnt disappointed with this things. i usually need speed and correctness for fingerprint and mobile itself for accessing payments and tickets while buying in shops or on a train.
im gona have to remove the pre installed screen protector of my s10+. when i put back covers on it gets bubbles in it. i really dont use screen protectors on my phones. im very carefull with them. 
i got the september update with new camera features on 26th  in uk. also the slight change in messages. also dynamic lockscreen display. 
still didnt get the sep update exynos  variant  india does anyone have any solution. 
hello does the samsung s10 snapdragon version available in dubai please respond give me an answer???!!!!
i have this phone and in 6 months broke the screen once and screen guard 4 times mind you only phone where i am having issues till date. thinking of switching to other brand as its a poorly designed model. heartbreaking to see my savings and trust go in drain by samsung.
i dont own this at first but a cousin who wishes to go for note 10 give this to me. he likes to use a flipcovermagnetic and i see the screen colour is saturated easily. i have to get a screen protector and a case to prevent further damage. probably in one or two years time a "s14 or 15" will appear. this technology we cant really follow it.
hi. i have some questions for you maggi since you have both phones im considering to buy s9+ and s10+. how is the curve on these phones? is it smaller on the s10+? is it noticable even? i didnt have a phone with a curved screen before now using j5 16 do you use some kind of notification led app for s10+?is the s9+ true led better? id like the led on the s9+ but dont know if its worth to buy it because of it if a good app can handle it for the s10+ just as much. im planning to buy either of the phones through a carrier so price isnt that much of a factor here both of them are expensive duhh and want to use a case and a good screen potector. what are your thoughts? thanks for the answer.
prism silver color is a beauty got mine on ebay and cant thank enough for the head turner it is. ah!
sorry about this.also with update when you press  camera a white  round circle  flashes on display around selfie camera. 
also changed with update. call text on any device or tablet. it used to be callsmessages continuity. 
also feature link to windows. 
also messages layout. beside were you go to text  beside it is gallery camera .
received update today which was 588.09mb. it came with features ar doodle super live focus video  and night selfie. dynamic lock.screen. anyone else get it?
anyone having problem with video in night mode? ive just checked it and its very grainy. s9 plus is better. i tried them both and s9 plus by far is the best when taking video in low light. i hope they send update to fix this!.
good phone but because of ugly punch hole i will go for note 9.
can the s10+ charge using the wireless charger like the s9+  with the same wireless charger????
great phone powerhouse indeed my friend andrew has it he loves it great 12+12+16mp cameras focus 100 i wish i had money to buy one at least an s10e but i always get a little phone or big cheap phones 4100mah battery will last 4 days on 23 and maybe 56 days on 100 thats standby light usage will probably give you 3.5 days medium 2.5 days heavy 1.5 days and fingerprint is fast for a flagship sseries good job samsung samsung is best oorah
how is the battery i am using data full day i only use whats app and background apps are off only whatsapp run in background  i have activated data saver.  in 10 hours or less battery goes near 20 percent and below. when i took it was 30  percent close at end of day 
and this phone gives us a fortnite skin
i hate the fact that samsung has lied to us when they said that they are considering releasing an update to enable the 25w fast charging. ive been waiting for it four months ago. i hope it will come soon but i really doubt it. otherwise its a great phone. no complains.
great anniversary phone. s10+ is a really well made gadget regardless of its chipset. 
lol this app actually recognises the i have galaxy s10+
battery life in the exynos version really sucks!!!!! 
im vacillating between s10+ and s9+. im not a big power user or gamer. is the curve smaller on this than on the s9+ like stated in the review? can somebody affirm this? and i like notification leds like on the s9+... is it worth to buy an s10+ instead of s9+ then at around the same price?
i bought my samsung galaxy s10 plus since may and have been enjoying it. but of recent the screen display of my phone frequently come up and last for about a minute even without an alert or a call. the is seriously draining my battery as we all know that samsung dont frequently have a strong battery. how do i stop this?
sir i had purchased a samsung s 10 mobile in the month of august from kerala. within a week the mobile fell down accidentally in a flight which i was travelling  the screen broke. i have used blackberry i phones  they have fell innumerable times but the screens were intact. after changing my display screen for inr 17000 from  a samsung gallery as the display was not under warranty or guarantee whatever term you may use the phone fell again  the expensive tempered glass cover which i had fixed on the screen broke  i had to replace it. i wonder if this model is such a delicate instrument  as it says in the specifications gorilla glass is present then why this display is always giving me problems. i have never used samsung earlier but one thing is sure  i will never use samsung phones again or refer it to anyone else. thank you very much.
does the samsung s10 plus snapdragon 855 version available in dubai
which isv best s10plus or note9 over all?
hope we get september patch update soon. i last got august update on 26th august. so hopefuly get it on that date. 
should i get the s10+ or note 10+? also how good is the battery life? can it last for 18 hours?
s11+ come on buddy! you are my next phone 128525!
seriously disappointing selfie cam....... 
folks i tried installing fonts apk but unable to change it as it says not supported. anyone tried other than existing galaxy fonts? thanks in advance. 
today i purchased a samsung galaxy s10 + please if you know tell me what settings need to be made to display 5 icons with applications on each row. thanks!
see s9 some users are getting 1st sept patch update. i think s9 plus and s10 plus should be getting it first as they are newer phones. even s7 edge got 1st sept patch update. 
hi ben. my apologizes again. it was on android 7.0 . after oreo it didnt support edge lighting in music. i think  my minds going lol . i lfeel really stupid now...........  my  mistake.
maggi let me make this clear again that there is already an edgelighting is given in your settings where you can customize your effects and lights of edge screen for particular apps. secondly if you want more effects on your edge screen and camera cut out then there are some apps which i mentioned before i.e. edgelighting + galaxy store always on edge play store and energy ring play store. however apps like always on edge and energy ring may drain your battery coz its a third party app but edgelighting + is a samsungs own app and its available on galaxy store.
found that feature in edge lighting. i usually use glitter effect. but if i change to bubble effect i can add diff colours to messages email etc. 
i am from bangladesh. i have purchased a samsung s10 plus mobile from saudi arabia last month. i used it for a few days there. now i have come to bangladesh. now i see only saudi arabia ads. i can not access to huawei and samsung bangladesh facebook page. i searched on facebook and found bangladesh page but i open the bangladesh page it automatically opens saudi arabian page. saudi arabian ip is probably on my mobile which cannot be changed. i wish your kind and best cooperation in this matter.
i wonder when we will get  1st september update.... 
 everything is so smooth. on this phone. . i have to point out that s10+ battery is amazing. i have s9 plus and battery on it is good. but i get longer on s10 +. i like both s10+ and s9 plus which ive only owned 9 months.  im glad both phones have calls  message continuity. ar emojis are the same as s9 plus got camera update like s10. but extra features on s10+. even though s10+ is 6.4 and s9 plus is 6.2 cant notice much diff in size.  but really happy owning s10+. 
android 10 you will not get rid of this problem the first problems with android 10 users complained about were frozen cell phone displays. these occurred on different google pixel models already at boot time during the android 10 update. in fact this should not be the worst problem. a completely different shortage causes much more trouble. android 10 is intended to break the sensor functionality of various pixel phones. however this can not be repaired as reported by bgr.com. special features fail on android 10 these include features such as autorotation of images automatic brightness active edge and tapping twice to turn on the screen that is no longer working on android 10. no matter how the android 10 update was executed the functions should run normally under android 9 but then no longer........ 
best device ive ever had except my xs max
why s10 plus not have face recognition and iris scanner are they overrated now?
good phone.good specs. except than long ugly notch which disfigures the look.
i noticed on the screen protecter s10+ came that there is a cut out for the camera.  so that must be the way samsung are making them.  cant have anything covering the camera. 
my battery drains fast . my data is on all the time i only use whats app. and i have activated data saver in it.
my battery draining out fast i only use whats app on data . my data is on all the time and i have activated data saver still battery goes drained fast
so you are saying that its not necessary to apply screen protector or 360 cover ? is that scratch resistant?
i have to say the battery on s10+ is amazing.  
the problem with screen protectors is that the glassplastic versions those that actually protect your screen does not work with the finger print sensor.
mine is dual sim. but i only need 1 sim. when i go into mgs to set a sound it comes up sim1 and sim2. mine would be the sim1?  can anyone explain this to me? 
samsung does not have screen protectors for the galaxy s10 plus yet. i just bought mine on aug. 125 2019 and it comes with one on it but they do not have them available for sale yet. the agent i had said they should be available soon  
great everyday companion for me it has a good camera battery and it is fast of course this is my opinion on this phone so please dont judge me.
the only thing that i dont like to this phone there is no infrared port.
face unlocked boring not working when lights off iphone x does... will never buy samsung again 
just found out s10+ came with build in screen protecter. i didnt know this. so i wont have to buy one which is good. 
i didnt know this phone was dual sim.  but i only use one sim and sd card.  i personally have no need for 2 sims. 
i bought s10 plus today. i thought i wouldnt have liked it. but i do. its nice and like thr camera features etc. 
hello. which phone should i purchase. the options are galaxy note 10 galaxy s10+ huawei p30 pro and the xperia 1. please help.
very very nice
its a huge beauty except for face unlock not accurate and annoying finger scanner oppo fine x is better face unlock and iphone x 
which one should i get? note 9 or s10+? the s10+ in my country is around 70 more expensive than the note 9
i am switching from xsmax to s10 plus.. is it worth switching? and im a pubg lover.. does it perform better than xsmax in pubg?
25 watt fast charging  when update will come in india
hey can an s10+ user tell me how it is to use the fingerprint especially with a glass screen protector. i have been doing some research and found that only 2 screen guards work on the phone but the problem is these are not available in my country and to ship them is stressthe time taxes and other stuffs. cause im in the market for a new phone and im trynna choose btw this and a galaxy note 9 and im kinda leaning towards the note 9 because i can use any old glass protector without worrying about it affecting the fingerprint. ps case and screen guard compatibility and ease of finding these are very important to me cause i need the device to serve a minimum of 3years but hopefully more than that. thanks in advance.
galaxy s10 s10e  s10+s horizontal rear camera suck its so disappointing. samsung screwed it. galaxy note 10  10+s vertical rear camera looks so much better than previous galaxy note 9s horizontal rear camera. im a biggest fan of vertical square or cube rear camera.
amazing performance...best of luck samsung...hoping a bigger change...
punchhole should be smaller and a single cam  only. isnt it?
i am undecided if i should buy the s10+ or the asus zenfone 6. what do you think. the punchhole camera is really annoying. i testedthe s10+ in the shop and i had to cut the screen in order to be able to ignore it. 
the best s10+ options is here in kazahkstan! we are very proud to buy quality products for low price! 
no dedicated memory card slot. really frustrating.
samsung galaxy s10 +. 8 gb ram  512 gb rom made in vietnam. very cheap price and quality is very low. battery very weak. which version region is better?  reply please. 10.08.2019
good.easy to use with oneui
does anyone have a problem with the original charging cable? mine just broke after 20 days of use.
top phone.. but only  one  error. useless double punchhole.
would you buy this or note 10 not the + version?
note 9 128 gb 6gb ram or samsung galaxy s10+8gb ram which one is better ??
well whether your device is sporting an exynos or snapdragon 855 chipset. it still the same hardware and software you use. 
great phone amazingly fast. no issue with the exynos edition.
i dont no why still to now galaxy samsung still to now so slowly in transferring file from phone to phone with this old bluetooth . and have plenty program more fast from bluetooth you can transfer file more fast to another phone .  have company work better to make her bluetooth more fast like another program . to be fast in transferring   wish company to work in this problem 
i use the samsung galaxy s10+ exynos model and it has been really great coming from samsung s9. the battery is awesome the display is wonderful and camera is brilliant. overall its top notch. i really do not know why people see exynos as a bad model. samsung are not fools for using the exynos and they know the effect of using a bad chip in their phones. lets wait and see if there are complaints from exynos users. so far with me the phones is amazing and i am loving it. 
hi .  which model of s10+ better ? snapdragon or exynos ?
hello world i got the an update dated 1 july 2019 today in saudi arabia. says some improvement to wifi camera bluetooth  security 
can someone test panorama with ultra wide lens in night mine get super noisy image and the centre of the image get white!! exynos model
why is no one talking about how the placement of the power button directly opposite all of the other buttons is an issue?!
comment above about pubg is false. pubg runs amazing on the galaxy s10 plus! i have all the graphics and frame rate settings to the max with anti aliasing on.. and the frame rate is above 60 fps! i have never seen a phone run a game as detailed as pubg at such a butter smooth framerate with no lag no hiccups no stutter! even the most powerful iphone xs max cant touch this!
when will under display selfie be available? i dislike notches.it  disfigures the screen.
what about the model number smg9750? is it legit? 
i regret buying this device . issue with my galaxy s10+. obvious redpink tint at slight angles. it will actually shift from red to blue at extreme angles .. i bought it from kuwait  .. they refuse to replace it or fix it ..they say nothing wrong with it and its normal ! 
guys  how is the battery in this phone in exynos version as there is some updates has been released so pls can anybody tell us how the exynos battery is ? is this processor good for games too ?
hello gamers and tech experts  please i need answers about   which soc is better the huawei  p30 pro kirin 980  or samsung s10+ in exynos version for games and durability ?
how do i sort all of the thousands of pictures in my camera by the date the picture was taken? i bought a new s10+ and all my pictures from the cloud were transferred without any order..
can some owners of sgs10 answer my questions? how bad is the curved screen? do you have lots of accidental touches? how is the current situation with exynosmodel and the gcam compatibility? anything you miss? i feel like sgs10+ is right now one of the most complete phones that is also getting more and more affordable now. and the plus model seems to be still reasonable sized just 74.1mm.
how do i sort all of the thousands of pictures in my camera by the date the picture was taken? i bought a new s10+ and all my pictures from the cloud were transferred without any order..
"oneplus is harder to handle" "galaxy is the better solution in the rain" "s10+s screen is a tad brighter" "if you are sick of tangled cables the s10+ offers that freedom" "if you like your photos sharper especially during the night the s10+ is the clear winner here. the same goes for video recording." "s10+ has more video modes and more advanced ones too." "galaxy s10+ having official ip68 ingress protection microsd card support and 3.5mm audio jack"... how come it all ends up with "choosing a clear winner here would be tough"!? just because "rooting wont void your warranty on the 7 pro"?
beautifully present 4
sorry just cant get past the freakin hole in the screen.
hey can anyone please suggest me a new phone to buy under 1000. i am using the s10 for a while and i want to buy a smartphone with stock android and good cameras with waterproof like ip68 or ip67. or i should stick with my s10 for sometime until another device launches. i am thinking of the pixel 3xl or maybe an iphone xs max.
i had exynos version before and it is ture it has better battery life after update to the latest version  but i want to highlight to you that exynos version is better from side of software for example i got update of night mood camera in my exynos version before ppl have snapdragon as supersaf youtuber said that overall the snapdragon is better for battery life but exynos is better to get software updates earlier ...anyway good luck and enjoy your new mobile 
bro can u tell me the latest verion information of yours galaxy s10+  i got last update on 1 july 2019 and what about yours share yours
dont buy exynos if you are using for gaming
why not all same varian ...i need snapdragon not exynos
hey can anyone please suggest me a new phone to buy under 1000. i am using the s10 for a while and i want to buy a smartphone with stock android and good cameras with waterproof like ip68 or ip67. or i should stick with my s10 for sometime until another device launches. i am thinking of the pixel 3xl or maybe an iphone xs max.
i am using the s10 + for about 2 months.  and i am happy with everything  only one issue i have is   the front camera fails and closes the camera app itself when i am using the live focus. hope it will be fixed in the update.
guys i am going to buy s10+ but i am confused which one to get snapdragon version or exynos?? in my country only exynos version is availablea lots off people commented that snapdragon version has better bettery life exynos version has bettery draining issueso please give me your opinion
which is best in general s10+ or iphone xsmax epecially in the camera ?!
wow! this is tremendously amazing!!!
hey guys  i need your advise and experience please  i wanna get a new phone but confused between s10 + exynos 9820 version   and huawei p30 pro  which one is better in battery life and performance for heavy gaming and net browsing ?? as i read some reviews  some of them  about battery drain issue in exynos version on s10+ while some comments on youtube video for battery test between the 2 versions said an update has been released and already fixing this problem and thinking about us ban on huawei if they didnt get agreement they could apply it again  so i need some answers please guys  anyone using exynos version has facing battery drain  can tell if it is a big problem or it is slightly issue due to hisher experience  ? and is it real that the latest update that reported fixing this matter in exynos s10+ specially in standby time ?  and in case us ban huawei again what could happen to the device software and apps ?   which one of these devices is better in general  ?   please give me your experience and advise ... thanks in advance .
guys am about to get a new phone  and i do really like the s10+ but would u guys think its a good move to go for it right now especially when the note 10 is about to launch or should i w8 over for the new beast ?
the s10+ is the perfect smartphone from samsung. the massive battery the awesome screen superb cameras and especially the headphone jack. the one ui is really good. it is a good improvement over their samsung experience which was disappointing. for the first time i am saying that i am liking an ui other than stock android.
i am still wondering why samsung company did not creat an option in this samsung galaxy 10 +  where by you can set your phone to on and off itself on a particular time while techno as cheap as it is has the said option. i think samsung should look into this.
i phones are overrated and over priced.samsung give good value for money.
it sucks iphone is the best. go find anthr phone. nothing is better than iphone xs max 
what i have found is that again fat32 is the format they are using again which means when you record more than 4 gb with your phone the phone will make another video and you will need a video editor to edit these files. this is frustrating because there are other companies who are using ntfs format which is in my opinion better than this one. anyway as far as i know there is no 4k limit to 10 minutes which is good.
i have compare s10 + oneplus 7pro in screen test s10 plus is the great quality in clarity pls buy only s10plus 
in super amoled and dynamic amoled see the difference and tell me 
oneplus 7 pro is better than s10 plus. oneplus is the star... 
got s10+ on 8th may and m in love with this prism black color amazing phone 
planning to get s10 plus  any recomendation
dynamic display bro not amoled display samsung is the best in display clarity 
s10 plus best phone for 2019. nothing comes even close  samsung is the best. 
to all videographers take note that samsungs r35000 flagship s10+ 1tb 12gb ram does not have pro mode in video. the only reason i bought this phone was to do stock video footage and r35000 later i found out that it only have a auto mode...oh but according to samsung it does have "super steady" feature...hoopty doo that solves my problem.......
why samsung why your flagship phone is getting slow after my 8months purchase i expected a beast performance but its not even best performance  am i the only one whos cursing for slow performance for 6months of usage ? 
overall performance is perfect! small crack on lower right hand side on it edge after it slipped my hand. such fragility for a highend phone. brought a screen guard in samsung store but it blocks the edges making edge lighting notification not visible. i removed it as it defeats the purpose of infinity display. on regular use mbl fb youtube battery lasts a day. please fix moisture detection bug.... 
guys have one question.. i am having the us unlocked version.. having no updates for the last 2 months.. am i missing out something or is there something else i should be doing ?
in s10plus  processor not qulacomm one right ? i think all the spec are nice except processor .
s10+ oneplus 7 pro iphone 8 plus or mate 20 pro? 
eeeexcellent camera phone. solid hardware. sd card and earphone jack chosen over huawei for this reason. but seriously messy os used to huawei. its too expensive for the overall experience id say. 
also available in prism silver in china

im thinking of buying a new phone. the budget is not a problem. im currently using a mid range phone from 2016 which i bought because of the 5000mah battery. ive been changing phones every two years. i really want to buy the s10+ but is it worth it spending a thousand bucks? or should i settle for another midrange phone? i bought the first galaxy and my dad is still using it. huawei is currently out of my options due to the issues. and im not a fan of pop out camera. most of my friends are recommending xiaomipocophone other chinese brands. lol. also not a fan of apple. 
can anyone tell when the update will come for s10 plus which allow 25watt charging ? 
if i buy from uae  will it work in india ?
why new samsung 1.1 interface on s10+. removed some common sense useful features that are in 9.5 interface on note 9? no longer option to answer phone call with a tap instead of swiping.  tapping on a contact widget from your desktop no longer initiates dialing the number. instead it  first asks you what you want to do next  to dial this contact or send a message to this contact.    common samsung! 
which camera is better s10+ or iphone xs max ? 
samsung did an excellent job with latest update for s10 plus especially camera night mode.
s10+ or a70 which one i should buy? 
between exynos 9820 and sd855 the snapdragon is certainly and definitely the better one. the current little performance and battery difference between those two will become bigger after a year or two. the samsung phone with exynos 9820 will be laggy as hell. just because of this reason people out of the usa and china have begun to buy huawei phones collectively instead of samsung. i think people should protest the double dealing of samsung by not buying samsung phones with exynos chips which are simply much inferior. 
did a reverse charge test with a gear s3 watch if anyone is interested. watch is 2 year old 380 mah by spec phone is new. at start watch  12 phone  67 after 2 hours 20 minutes watch  100 phone  35 watch was warm but not very hot. phone was just barely warm.
when i look with the comparizon tool im wondering about the bad image quality in low light and even in good light. samsung steps backwards. you can clearly see the enormous noise reduction making the whole picture washed out and extreme sharpening destroyes the rest!
i want to buy a new flagship phone but i cant decide which one i should buy.i like to play high resolution games in phone and i do some photography.  so should i buy xsxs max or s10+ which one please guide me       
the display is very easy to scratch without falls or putting it in the pocket with keys etc. i dont know about i phones but definitely after many years i will switch from samsung to apple.

hi all anyone found a telephoto camera on their unit?  i tried covering cameras one by one and changing settings  nearest to the led flash is wide camera in the middle is the "standard" camera with variable aperture and the farthest camera from the led seems to do nothing i covered it and all functions and zoom levels still worked. very strange behavior.
 i am currently thinking about getting a new phoneyour suggestion pls s10 plus apple xs max p30 pro
after a long time of use whos the best ? s9+ or s10+?
it is water proof?
for the guys thing that snapdragon 855 are faster than exyons 9820 and they doesnã‚â€™t even used exyons 9820 i used both and exyons 9820 in day to day use better than snapdragon 855 battery life got fixed with security patch and overall performance exyons 9820 better except for some games like pubg and few games but still can runs all games without issue. samsung with security patches fix issues with there phones since s7.
hi just wanted to know is the exynos chipset slower than snapdragon
is the exynos chipset slower than the snapgragon chipset?
look i have been using xs max and been a loyal apple fan for almost 10 years.. just got a s10 plus snapdragon variant.. this is a game changer..finally i am switching.. kudos to sammy this year !
im very disappointed in samsung. there is no notification light there is no iris the face unlock does not work best the fingerprint does not work properly the difference in cameras compared to note9 is not difference 3d home button is ejected ..... do not buy this phone because all good things to which you are accustomed they are ejected. theyre trying to make the phone stupid like apple did.
any one facing wifi drop issue with s10 plus exyons i got the may security patch and thereã‚â€™s wifi improvement with may patch including camera improvement night mode lot better now but wifi still not that good canã‚â€™t even play pubg due to wifi drop .
how is the battery backup of s10 plus???
so between s10 plus exynos and oneplus 7 pro which one has a better battery endurance? i am kind of confused between these two phones but battery endurance is a very important factor when buying a phone.  i know the exynos version is a bit inferior to the us sd855 version but given the current price i am willing to buy it only if the battery life is good enough.
hello guysi want to ask something. i am currently thinking about getting a new phoneand theyre both flagshipsbut the question is should i get the note 9 or s10+? i am a kindofheavy useri sometimes do gaming but mostly social media.alsoboth would be 8gb.i would like to hear some of your guys opinions.

got s10+ prism black 128gb i just love it but why samsung took off notification led light but overall its best phone 
i agree best phone has it all vs oneplus 7 that has almost nothing to offer lol.. what a waste to buy it a oneplus today xd
best of best!
how does samsung s10 5g has 25w charging while s10 plus has not with the same hardware.
which better for lowlight selfie camera quality? 1. oneplus 7 pro 2. galaxy s10 plus please help me
i like to buy s10+ but also waiting for the note 10 which will be more expensive than the s10+ smh
i moved from my samsung note 8 to samsung s10 +. i think that samsug is going in the good way. very good smartphone with very good hardware.
i have mixed feelings about the s10+ after switching from the p30 pro i was highly impressed by the screen fluidity and video performance of the s10+. what i can however say is that i am not too impressed by battery performance and the still photography needs a bit of work.  overall samsung has always offered a good recipe that just works. its not a bad phone by any means but there are definitely areas that can be improved. 
any one s10+ user. please help me. how about the selfie camera quality in low light?
after google plus shutdown i cant change play store account background image. can anyone help me? 
my s10 plus the battery runs down faster than i thought
i feel like samsung has been very good with their phones lately. while there is the s7 problem everything else has been designed well for a more powerful affordable and highend phone. i know that this usually isnt a good thing but i like how using the wideangle lens vertically distorts images because it widens it the other way. some people will argue that the samsung phones are bad because they are not reliable and that they rush to get things done. but i think that if it works its okay.
i am really tempted to get one s10+  but i will patiently wait for the note 10 to come out
a smartphone cant get better than this!!!
its best dream smart phone in the world
stereo speakers are at its best on samsung galaxy s10 plus 
just wake up the screen and its gorgeous display blows out all other phones
actually only zoom feature just zoom feature is not appropriately addressed by samsung otherwise its nearly perfect phone 
battery life is not a problem in samsung galaxy s10 plus 
nothing wrong with battery it lasts good depends also how use phone etc.. but i have no issues and i use gps alot since  iplay pokemon go i can last many hours.
checked the phone yesterday and camera is lit like they have this zoom feature that even pores in ur face is very noticeable hoping to get one of these heard a lot of good reviews on this 
what if samsung puts release this phone with android one that would be the killer of all phones. please samsung give it a try
to those who are using the s10 plus for about two months time is there a sign of batteryã‚â€™s weakening? mind to share?
if youre obsessed to zoom your photos than huawei p30 pro is better otherwise no other phone can compete samsung galaxy s10 plus. 
s10 phone is the best phone in the market. there speakers are awesome plus the camera clarity plus the share power option is awesome
huawei mate 20 pro vs samsung galaxy s10 plus which is best
i just playing around with my brothers brand new s10+. surprisingly the one ui still got the stutter  a bit laggy effects sometimes just like older ui especially upon unlocking  swipe to bixby page. and he complains a lot about the fps inconsistency.  comparing camera image quality with my mate 20 looks like mate 20 a lot better especially low lights. display  video recording superior on s10+ though. but mate 20 1080p video quality are neck to neck with the s10+.
amazing!!!!!!!! after update.....
so how much ram is actually used by the system and will be they be like 9 10 gb ram free  does the apps hold in the ram for long time  does it even use more than 5 gb in total 
most overrated phone of 2019128517128521
okay so despite my grumbles in the s9+ thread re the drawbacks of the s10 series i went and tradedinup for the s10 plus tradein offer too good additional 10 off and lots of birthday money. new toys and all that... . as many others have echoed its a tad faster the camera is largely the same except for the new ultrawide angle its lighter than the s9+ and the new trim i bought the prism blue makes it stand out.  the pill hole isnt an issue in daytoday use.   however the biggest issue like others is over the ultrasonic fp reader. it was an absolutely nightmare to even setup it kept saying to press harder. it felt like i was going to break the screen at one point. it simply wasnt registering my right thumb and my index finger only worked with again excessive pressure.    i then got my girlfriend to attempt it. lo and behold it accepted her pinkies  thumb without any real strain. eh? so tried again. i eventually managed to get a thumb done. nb i have not removed the factory installed protector. then trying to unlock in normal use it barely works. "press a little harder" or "cover the entire sensor" being the 2 responses. not a great start and seriously considered sending it back. but oddly though once in the device itself samsung pay pass my hsbc banking app all accept my fingerprint wo problems. i am ultimately only managing to unlock when wanting to use the fp reader only if ive applied handcream to my thumb in particular. then it works fine.  so unless you have baby soft skin all round you may well struggle with this and then decide to use the very fast facial recognition option instead.  go figure.... any finger tips welcomed!
just bought it with some offer in my country 720. 128 8gb . is it worth it ?
samsung should sell external lenses kit separately which fits perfectly and boost camera performance. 
even though camera is not best but this is the best mobile in all other aspects 
why the iris scanner is not in s10plus
note 9 is better than s10 plus 
after reading these comments why do i feel glad having an s9 plus which is one year old already... haha
best smartphone ever.
samsung just failed to improve in camera technology compared to current flagship smartphones otherwise its perfect 
s10plus is samsung s series 10th anniversary phone.. nd it dont have a super night mode nd live video focus like huawei p30pro.. then its big big biggg shame for samsung... im saying this after dedicated night mode software update... dedicated night mode update is just nothing compared to huawei p30pro 
users buy samsung flagship mobiles because of their top notch features and galaxy s 10 plus excels in all departments except photography. it is incremental upgrade since s7 edge age in camera department and mobile cameras are big let down in this mobile i was previously note 8 user seriously disappointed and wont buy note 10 if they dont come up with groundbreaking camera features. samsung you are losing in camera race
see all this technology in samsung s10 + and still samsung so poor in transfer file from phone to another phone still using bluetooth very old program .  didnt reach to now make special something to her phone about this only you have all time install another program from play store to work 
best phone ever. feels very premium great battery life no lags what so ever
samsung should work harder and bring better update to bring remarkable improvements in camera performance at least it should overcome pixels and iphone which are now 6 months old which is big period in mobile world 
to people in the us i have the nexus 6p now and i want to upgrade. do i get a snapdragon s10+ or note 9? ive never owned a note phone so i dont know what its like to miss the spen but isnt it better to have the spen even if you dont need it than to realize you need it and not have it? will i notice a difference between the sd 855 and sd 845? how is the battery life and standby time between the phones? im not a heavy user. i dont play games or benchmark and i only take pointandshoot photos so i need a phone that wont lose a lot of battery when im not using it. im planning to keep my next phone for three years so im not worried about 5g but i want to be as future proof as possible. what should i do?
soon update will add night mode to camera.. very nice!!
no indication led for charging as well as in s series kindly do something in software update
cameras are underwhelming as per current flagship standards.
i like so much this phone but i dont aproved the face lock that guy broken the security with a photo httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v=sl5xpq5e4ks 
upgraded from s8+ to s10+ and it has been the most underwhelming upgrade for me ever. actually miss the grooved fingerprint scanner at the back of the s8. effortless compared to the target practice required for s10. no significant difference in camera. phone speed only slightly better. i am still struggling to see why i chose to start making payments on a new phone when i was just a few months away from finishing payments on my s8. to convince me even further i tried to use the s10+ as a hotspot for another device and saw it on the network still showing as s8+.  what more proof do you need?
this site is calling the release of the worlds first 5g phone for may when they claim that samsung has their 5g phone out now. it isnt. look it up anywhere except the official site because if you are stupid enough to order from samsung.com youre going to be waiting a long time.
s10+ or huawei p30 pro ?
must ban comments which speak about other brands because they are advertisements
what keeps me away from buying the s10+  non exciting colors  one ui may lag after 1 year of usage  camera not upto par and future proof. new iphone may destroy it all together.   no ir blaster  sd855 version not available in market  battery life of exynos version is not clear   polarising notch what attracts me to s10+   exploring one ui   display  stereo speakers
does any one also faces heating issue whne updating the cell phone ?
just bought and has been using for last 4 hours constantly... just wow... believe me its a superb fone... no word to express my love.. upgraded from s9 plus.. i feel the swiftness and screen improvements 
im in indonesia too my experience buying samsung phone that not made for our country  make that phones cant use 4g network even worse can use sim card  because every country have diffrent network band 
guys i need help. i am living in indonesia and yet from my researched it shows that snapdragon version is better. but the snapdragon is not available in my country. i have source and i can buy it in china with snapdragon version. the question is if i buy the snapdragon version in china can i use the phone in indonesia? and also other countries? please help!
guys i have a question. i wanna buy the snapdragon version so bad but i am living in indonesia. i have source to purchase one in china. is the snapdragon version useable in indonesia? please help!
which is the best phone note 9 or s10+?
hi i m confuse to buy samsung galaxy s10plus or note9 which phone is better...heared that s10plus a lot of issue and complain many? 
any heating issue in samsung galaxy s10+ in normal conditions and during charging 
had this phone but returned it. exynos battery life wasnt what i expected. build quality is great screen is beautiful but i still think samsung ui needs tweaking. new icons are too childish and all that unused whitespace for one handed mode is visually offputting 
us vs regular camer comparison.httpsyoutu.be7zxnck5lou0 
hi. im thinking of buying this phone or the huawei p30 pro. im a bit concerned with the battery. those who have the exynos model can say if is true about the battery drain or the battery is good? im not a heavy user. i only use the phone to check email facebook some web pages and that is all. thanks
pretty much problems with bad reception...my last phone was note 9 and i didnt have any problems with reception like with  10 plus.
i have issue with screen protector fingerprint sencer  over all performace is very good. with glass screen  protector  fingerprint sensor is not working  is there any compatible glass screen protector? 
i bought the phone last month and was complaining a lot about battery just to clarify those comments of mine battery is getting better day by day i guess its because the apps and battery is calibrated after some charging cycles and updates. on heavy to moderate use it goes a day and quarter on single charge. and on light to moderate use i get 2 days now. camera is superb. hole punch is better than a notch. nothing to complain about. two thumbs up.
i have an s10 plus. sorry to say i am really disappointed  in its camera. i also own a pixel 2 xl and the rear and selfie cams are much much sharper than the s10 plus. so much so in fact that im returning my s10 plus and will probably get a p30.  i am no camera expert ive only done basic shots but in day and low light the pixel 2 xl outperforms the s10 plus given the fact its a phone from 2017 its really disappointing on the s10 plus front.  my partner has an iphone xr and that too produces cleaner sharper images.  the only thing the s10 plus is better at is video.  not sure how it gets such a high score. maybe im wrong and its just my opinion and i can only judge off photos taken of our little baby which is what we mainly use our camera phones for. but it just doesnt produce shots as good as it should in my opinion.  i am not a samsung hater either im just a disappointed customer to be honest.  seriously considering a p30 now. 
in the next update the ability of charging gonna go up from 15w to 25w from software.
i recently bought the galaxy s10+. it is a great smartphone overall but there is something annoying to me. when i listen to music or videos the back of the phone vibrates a lot a lot more compared to s9+ or note 8. does anyone else experiencing the same same thing? 
i like this phone so much i am gonna get it
i work with samsung call center and to be honest we have a lot of complaint about s10. though i am working with samsung but i am a iphone user.
litterally nobody is using this one in the malls. i never see people using s10+. so as expected the sales are poor. they are using the media to spread lies about sales in order for people to buy. but in reality no one is buying. the crowd will tell.
show you take off the preapplied screen cover on front or not ?
i think that galaxy s9 and note9 was better because of the putting of front cameracameras holeholes in the corner of the screen of the galaxy s10 generation whixh seem to look like deed pixels or something like that.. and so display affected badly. i can not see why do they do such thing like notch iphone x series huawei mate 20 series .. ect
leave they are copying or not just check the build quality samsung has done what other  are want.
the music not working when you close the smart cover and the its shut off like youtube its disappintening thing 128549
so i am using samsung s10plus for two week nowand i am not happy with it... it hangs sometimes and the fingerprint lock sucks 
as long as they copy the right things we shouldnt have any problems lol....
samsung will definitely not sell because of this p30the preorder offer is crazy!
can i hide the punch cameras like i can hide the notch in other devices? and whats the screens size when hidden?  6.1"? 
lower pixels of cameras means lower zoom. for its price and being flagship its cameras must be 120 mp   or at least 50 mp  not 12 mp  for main cameras and lower in selfie.
rubbish akg  headphone
i only wanna know why samsung gives exynos chipset to asian countries while the west gets the more powerful snapdragon 855??!!! will not touch samsung again after this s10+...paid 70 usd for the phone with 2 years subscription contract of 30 usdmonth so im still not that pissed haha...
endurance rating of samsung galaxy note 9 is 97 and samsung galaxy s10 plus is 91. when endurance rating of note 9 is greater than s10 plus then how battery timing of s10 plus better than note 9 .? can anyone explain. 
hello guys! i am wondering which one to buy s10+ or mi mix 3. believe it or not in my country their price is very similar. samsung s10+ i can buy with slight discount signing 2 years contract with my mobile data provider for 730 dollars and mi mix 3 without contract from retailer for 550 dollars. so i wonder which one to buy. as you can see the price tag is not that of a matter but i wonder whats your opinion. i am looking for a long term device. i prefer to use it as long as it is possible. my last one was note 3 neo and god is witness this is one of a fine phone.i used it for 4.5 years and it still works excellent just too slow because of the old os.  so what do you think? which one would you buy? thank you in advance! 
samsung really upped their game by producing this excellent s10 devices. to me they really are great devices for everyday smartphone needs. currently using mate20 pro thoand s9 as secondary and not planning to get an s10. huawei always wins my heart. lols. 
this is a copy of huawei mate 20 pro with a headphone jack i think i know now who is the copycat
s10 plus and p30 pro. both are the heavyweights of the smartphone game. no phones come close
i guess huawei is the new galaxy s now. advantages of p30 pro 1 better battery life 2 better ui not cartoonish like samsungs one ui 3 ir blaster to control my samsung tv for which i have lost my remote. 4 much better camera in low light. 5 much better zoom for outdoor hikes 6 better gps as it supports gallieo and others sattelites 7 better fingerprint scanner as it doesnt need an ugly hole in my screen protector to work properly 8 better loudspeaker as it uses new tech to cancel out almost all noise  very useful in loud environments like night clubs. 9 no gimmicks that take up battery space like headphone jackheart rate sensorbarometer which is what my galaxy watch lte is for and does better job than my s9+ 10 much faster charging 11 more efficient 1080p screen to save battery i keep my s9+ on fhd all the time 12 more optimized since all p30 pros use inhouse kirin vs samsungs half exynos and half snapdragon with each cpugpu features being cut down to match the other to keep them performing at similar level. 13 no ugly camera cutouts as huawei provides an option least on p30 pro to completely hide its front facing camera. i can go on all day.... advantages of s10+ 1 brighter and sharper screen for outdoor usage so you can drain your battery even faster. 2 stereo speakers 3 i dont know maybe hdr10+ when it actually works but thats all i can think of really. i dont know what else. please leave a comment in a section below. but to be honest this is 2nd largest disappointing galaxy s device in samsungs history after galaxy s6 ofcourse that removed sd card and waterproffing but this one removes notification light and iris for a big black hole.... 128577
hi i just saw in youtube that they are releasing a software update for night mode and the camera itself lets see how they pull this one out i hope it improves the camera specially the night mode just like pixel does with their software updates to improve it.
what kind of improvement has brought s10plus in the latest security patch? nothing. obviously yes. no improvement is given instead the company is earning by giving an update. see by the end of march we received the march security update. when will we get april update? ok let it be. camera especially in night mode utmost grainy photos i have ever seen in the flagship such a worst photos. dynamic range another awkward in s10 family even in daylight photos. 
samsung should price their mobile phones for 600that is the sweet spot for them to sell. 
what are the best new features in samsung s10+?
comparison between galaxy s10+ and p30 pro  screen s10+ samsung has excellent amoled screens and the fact that p30 series uses samsung screens is an undeniable testament to that. p30 pros oled screen is very good too and is no slouch!  battery p30 pro huawei phones have excellent battery life and battery management processes as proven by mate 20 and mate 20 pro partly due to its power efficirnt kirin processors. battery life of samsung phones are great too but are known to degrade fairly fast as i have used galaxy note8 in the past. my friends who are samsung users also notice that too. quantity and numbers do not solely determine the quality of the smartphone battery  charging capabilities p30 pro both have fast charging wirelessreverse wireless charging but p30 pro generally charge up slightly faster. to be frank this is not really a feature that is worth comparing lol having fast charging and fast chargers in the box makes both of these phones amazing already unlike a certain fruit phone   processor s10+ but must be sd 855 variant exynos is a big no go kirin 980 and sd 855 are very comparable but in terms of other departments such as emulator gaming that utilizes more complicated graphic processes sd 855 performs better and thus edges kirin 980 out  storage capabilities s10+ microsd cards are more accessible and cheaper than nanosd cards but that does not deny the fact that mate 20 series and p30 series can still expand storage just as well something that people always overlook and undermine huawei about. i will give this to s10+ due to the greater availability of microsd cards worldwide  back camera to be determined p30 pro > s10+ on paper particularly due to its phenomenal telephoto periscope camera that offers up to 5x optical zoom and up to 50x digital zoom! also it is interesting to note that p30 series uses ryb sensors for its cameras as opposed to the conventional rgb sensor which increases p30 cameras light intake by up to 40 and hence allows p30 series to take better night shots as claimed by huawei. all to be tested and confirmed through comparisons  video capabilities to be determined s10+ > p30 pro on paper s10+ can take 4k60fps unlike p30 pro  selfie camera s10+ no brainer huawei selfie cameras are generally poor due to absence of auto focus. also s10+ has 2 selfie cameras too  features exclusive to p30 pro ir blaster very useful!  features exclusive to s10+ audio jack . conclusion both are excellent phones! if you value battery and state of the art camera above everything else go with p30 pro! if you want an amazing phone with consistently great features all around as well as an audio jack go with s10+!
helloi just brought s10+ its ok smartphone of 2019 but not so that great. samsung need o fix fingerprint readerits not accurate.and i am having trouble wih it sometimes.
factory screen protector for samsung s10+ started to peal off after 17 days.  when i took it off it was like cheap plastic like shrink wrap attached to the phone face.
i have heard from my friend that samsung galaxy s10 plus mostly heats greater than normal. is its true 
i got the 512gb exynos s10+ its great but for four issues 1 very serious issues of bad palm rejection on the edges. i keep mistyping and sending messages too early. and i cant seem to be able to set up properly the samsung edge touch app presumably meant to deal with this issue. 2 serious issue no notification lights! unbelievable but true 3 less serious issue unless youre not happy to rely on the average security of the face detection camera even after the upgrade using the fingerprint reader is a chore 4 less serious issue it is almost always warm
really nice phone but simply costs too much. sorry samsung you lost me at 600 usd.
should i upgrade from my samsung galaxy note 8 to samsung galaxy s10 plus or i should wait for huawei p30 pro  because huawei p30 pro cheaper as compared to samsung galaxy s10 plus. please needs your suggestions 
1. the display is definitely one that cannot be replaced it is almost impeccable. and as much as people want to complain about the hole punch. love it it give the edges of the screen the sense it deserves with it being a no bezel phone.  2. the battery. oh my god. okay so the battery is quite a major upgrade since my previous device gs8 although i knew the note 9 offered the same but getting the note 9 was not something i am into. i am not fond of the note series. i get a good percentage left when i come back home to charge it up 3. the design. top of the line almost impeccable although i do have to get used to the hole punch i currently enjoy the very presence of it giving my phone a futuristic feel as i gaze at my notification panel an fine 2 lenses waiting to be used. the feel of the phone itself roars premium value and that is something i am very fond of while using the device.  4. performance. this phone is and is beyond those phones that were specialized for gaming. although there are so me questionable components which justify this a fair argument could be made to confirm the potential this phone has of handling its games. 5. camera . now the phone itself is a power house and this powerhouse holds 3 rear facing lenses and 2 front. hands down perhaps the best ive seen  or maybe perhaps the best out there. just perfect 
the samsung s10 plus "for me is almost perfect but !!! " when it comes on the design on the front of this phone much better if this will be a  " tear drop " rather than the " punch hole like a dead pixel " no offence  samsung fan boys 
does this phone have inbuilt call recording feature? if have then i will buy otherwise i will not waste money. 
hope samsung dont go  down this road again with the hole in screen for camera. not nice at all. why they did that is beyond me. so i wont be upgrading to this phone. not worth it.  i hope next one one comes out they will do away with it. 
i have owned every samsung flagship since s4. but before buying s10+ i will wait up to 3 months max. if this hole punch notch screen is transferred to low or mid end range then i will either switch to apple for good or never gonna buy flagship again.. i spend bucks to differentiate my mobile both looks and performance wise but everytime samsung transfer looks to lower end although performance and camera of flagship is unparalleled but still physical outlook is equally important to stand out... so samsung shall limit the looks of flagship to flagship only. 
friends please suggest about battery backup of s10 plus  many are saying it is not good i am planning to buy this week
it all comes to an end when you hear huawei reaching out samsung for oled.
such a dissapointment...  had s10+ for a week and very glad i did not sell my huawei mate 20 pro. here is why 1. battery. s10+ can not hold for a day. even charging during the day.... if you once try huawei fast charging then you know what fast charging means. s10+ can not do fast charging. 2. managing mobile data. i live in area where 4 states come together. means you change networks without end. s10+ cant do it. it was the reason i switched from s7 to huawei honor and later mate and p and mate again. few gens later s10+ still cant do it. i drive for 20km from one state to another to successfully switch mobile data from one sim to another. huawei can make it in a blink of an eye. with s10+ even calls are not possible for a long time passing the border. 3. bluetooth. in my tesla everytime i begin the drive first call with s10+ i am connected but i do not hear nothing. so i had allways to call once wait 2 sec hang up and repeat the call. huawei mate 20 pro works like swiss watch from the first fime. 4. fingerprint. in s10+ you can call it fingerprint under developement beta alfa stage. it does not work. 5. face recognition. s10+ do not function in the dark. i am so glad i did not sell yet my mate 20 pro. so much better phone. now i know why samsung can not beat apple. its simple. it is not good enough. sad this comes from big samsung fan over a decade from sdh600 or something like that to s7edge. please begin the making of a review more profesional way. i know you are making the site for money but what world we will have if e.g. journalists do not write what they foud wattergate...
best phone on the market hands down very powerfull soc best screen very good cameras and extremely good looking phone it is pricey but well worth it 
wow the s10 range is the fastest selling flagship for years. huawei and samsung are so ahead when it comes to technology and giving the consumer what they desire. well done to both companies. 
all future phone standards will be compared to the record breaking s10 series. thank you samsung 
anybody facing frame drops in pubg full settings on exynos version s10+ im facing please help as compare to oneplus 6t ihad before which had smooth experience with pubg full settings.
please comperison gsm arena s10+ camera vs i phone xs and pixal 3 xl please update comperison
when it comes to the design of the phone ill go for huawei p30 pro. rather than the design of s10 plus. sorry sammy but that punch hole is a trash. and also see the review on youtube. when it comes gaming and watching movie. what is the use of bezel less if that st2pid punch hole
amazing phone. the screen is gorgeous. the build is excellent. the features are plentiful. its fast. it has plenty of storage. what a great phone. also fm radio is also available on the chinese model so all snapdragon phones have the radio.
best phone ever.
hi guys i want ur suggestion currently im using a series a5 2017 midrange model which is the best upgrade phone s10 or s10 plus give ur comments thanks!
samsung and all companies either you make batteries removable to change them easily when expired or you make lifelong batteries which never expire as new inventions 
all cameras must be 50 mp 
im hearing the exynos version has weak battery? 
nubia x is better implementation compared to this ominfinity o display
i think this phone is great. huawei is also catching up. i believe they are both brother from the same mother... lol
well nice phone but i have problem with pubg mobile it laggs no matter what settings i  use exynos variant
as a practical and business user of both the note 8 and the mate 20x there is even no basis for comparison the huawei simply makes the samsung a toy feature phone. from how the screen is better and easier on eyes to speed battery life and camera.
lol.. i doubt that huawei needs any "fanboys" to speak for them. samsung is simply inferior on all levels and in every aspect to the huawei recent roll oit of phones. in my peesonal experience the huawei mate 20x with the m pen challenges every meaning of what a smartphone should be and defines the word note. huawei is simply an efficient practical userfriendly and core valueformoney option in the android world. its not a competition huawei phones are better value for money than whatever samsung is offering.
well nice phone but i have problem with pubg mobile it laggs no matter what settings i  use exynos variant
keep on trolling oppo huawei vivo users. s10+ ipxs users doesnt care all your rants. 
the beast..it is really worth to buy this128077128526
cameras must be 25 mp at least
camera hole is so embarrassed. red bad think and power button is top of the phone is ao bad not comfortable.1280781280781280â­78
after update to pie  will  i do a  factory reset?  
i have to write few words. your reviews are worth nothing. i wrote this a while ago but nothing changed. i have been using samsung phones until s7 and then switch to huawei honor and later to mate pro and p10 pro p20 pro... huawei phones are simply better. not by small margin but by huge step. why? battery on samsung holds 34 of a day. huawei goes 1 and 12 day. i can not belive you made such bad endurance tests. i have same apps installed same usage thru the day so i can tell real live not artificial tests. charging s10+ is extreme slow. in 2019 if you call 15w charging fast i do not know why you are doing this bussiness. huawei goes 40w. yes thats fast. samsung can use "fast" charging only with his charger. huawei can use more than just original. connect phone to notebook and move photos from dcim to notebook? nearly imposible with samsung s9 same as s10+. as soon you select photos and moves files to notebook an error ocures. huawei mate 20 pro can do it without problems. going to another country with samsung is pain in t.a... and this goes thru more generations not only s10+. it takes forever phone to switch to another provider in foreign country. phone can not switch providers... what helps is downgrade from lte to 3g. but this is not bug of this years phone. so was already in s6 s7 edge. in huawei you switch data from one sim to another if you wish and you are back in internet. safe apps? in huawei you just select app to need fingerprint to opens. thats it. in samsung you have to login to "security folder" and here you can have apps and files that are under fingerprint. separated. and you have to go whole setup proces from begin e.g. bank apps or nuki chainlock or various authenticators. apps 1. phone and 2. contacts are two separated apps. if you go to phone you can see contacts in your phone but if you take app contacts you can only see contacts. you can not switch to last contacts or to numbers. in huawei you can tell in a second if you are in 24 or in 5 ghz wifi network. i can not see that in samsung. did you ever try to install new sonoff product that only works with 24 ghz? no problem for huawei. in huawei i can allways see how fast my data connection  transfers is. i can not do this with samsung s10+. i have to open chrome then refresh a page to see if i am actually on internet. fingerprint in huawei mate 20 pro is not as good as previous generations that were not under display. but samsung? i have to try somtimes 10 times to open my phone and that means waiting because phone locks for 30 sec. and pressing to display like making a hole in it is not enough. still saying please press harder. that fingerprint in s10+ is going on the edge of usability.  so now is 1521 and my new shiny s10+ has only 53 left. that means i have to charge it or i will not make it until late in the night celebrating a friends birthday.  conclusion samsung simply is not as good as huawei cpu power or super amoled means nothing. or?  and 2nd conclusion if you make reviews make reviews not only showing how cool you can open the box and how cool you are holding it in the hand.
people should stop buying this flagship phones that cost almost 1.5k. its even more expensive now compared to a motor bike. with 125cc engine. 
i had mate 20 pro from 1st november. just switched to s10+ mate 20 pro over s10+  way better ultrafast charging  camera nightmode  way way better . although  when i installed google camera on s10+ the night photos are great. and no need to stay 5 sec not moving my hand  way way better ergonomics  the buttons are exactly where they should be. with s10+ they are exactly the opposite location   ir blaster  extremely usefulll  way better network signal better wi fi better download speed. everything about conectivity is fast  born fast stay fast. all my samsungs s2478 and note 1234 were lagging after 45 months of usage . mate 20 pro = exactly like new out of the box . i am  indeed a heavy heavy user but i dont care. if huawei can do it  samsung should do it. i hope they soled it with s10   better zoom camera   way more sharper camera   natural colors in pictures  it is a matter of taste. i prefer the vivid mode on s10. but some people prefer more realistic photos   no bixby button  really is so anoying unsusefull button  better handling for less wider than s10+ . it is a significally difference  s10+ over mate 20 pro  better display. not way better but visibile on 4k video youtube side by side  way way way better stereo speakers  both volume and quality  way way beter video camera  both selfie and rear camera  gourgeous steady video mode    oneui way way way way better than emui  there are too many things that samsung is so so intuitive and knows what i want that huawei is the oposite. for example autobrightness in samsung i can turn off not with huawei. also in camera mode in video mode i can switch between angle zoom the way i want. in mate20 pro is laggy and only in order.   i can make video with wide camera mode. in mate20 pro the widecamera video is like the regular video in samsung. doesnt let me film wider angle image. and is very frustrating to have a ultrawide lens and doesnt let me use it on video  i can make a panorama in ultrawide mode  to get everything into the picture. at huawei when i turn to panorama mode it switches automatically to regular angle camera     the panorama soft on s10 is way way way better than huaweis one both on dinamic range between different lighting conditions of such a large photo and correcting your hand shaking !!!!  all cameras are the same  great. mate 20 pro has different colours dinamic range soft for zoom one ultrawide one and the regular one. the regular one is great gteat the zoom one is just great the ultrawide one is so and so   way better dinamic range on s10 over the mate 20 pro   wider 123 degree on ultrawide angle lens on s10 over just 107 degree on mate 20 pro. it is more usefull wider as i want to get more and more into the picture   better display in direct sunlight  way better pictures in daylight  better colours better dinamic range  although the zoom camera is better on mate 20 pro i found much more usefull the 2x zoom than the 3x of huaweis . i found myself many times too zoom in from 3x in mate 20 pro to 2x. somehow samsung knew how far i really need to zoom in   shot suggestion mode  is so so so addictive. all your photos are now great . it is so usefull. one has to use it to see how great it is  edge  i 100 hate hate the edge display but s10 edge is smaller than the mate20 pro and more maneouvrable. samsung has experience with edge panels... s7 edge was worst  hole in display is more modern than notch. though vivo selfie cam that pops up from the phone is the best way to do it  dark mode  is so so dope   autorotate display is so much more responive on s10. at mate20 pro is so so slow to respond you wonder if it shall rotate ...   heart rate sensor  is is there if some use it 
this phone is not that far to be the best phone at least for this year. i really dont mind the holepunch thing. also i had an idea for it by using wallpapers but way different than the already custom ones. two things that samsung did wrong with this device are 1 they did not make a 12gb ram  512gb rom combination but instead they went for the highest capacity of storage that ever existed on a cellphone by adding other 512gbs on the already existing 512gbs to reach and sell 1tb of internal storage phones. not only that this is a ridiculous amount of internal storage for a phone but also increases and the price of the phone by much. also almost none would fill all the 1tbs within one year until the next device. and 2 they didnt delay the s10+ to make it 5g capable. instead they decided to make and a fourth version of this phone with increased dimensions and only one slot on the sim tray for the 5g nanosim. if those two problems did not exist perhaps it would win the title for the phone of the year.
lg v30 design is perfect for a smart phone. not too small or big. its just right. 
for me the s10 series is flop and disappointment. ill wait for note 10 or s11
how much price of 1 tb 12 gb version? uro?
i think that camera hole is obstructing the whole screen view experience. not a wise decision. 
sold my xs and bought s10+ amazing device nothing to complain about with respect to looks performance  camera. what is really annoying is battery life i had a mate 20 pro for a shorter period of time but that thing had amazing battery life best of any android ive ever used. s10+ is giving me problem i charge it at my office desk unplug at 10 am. and by the end of the day i am at 20ish something the real issue is in the morning with datawifi off phone not used at all it drops 1015 battery. samsung please optimize things to give a good battery experince. even my note 8 is performing better after pieone ui update!
i very much like this phone though it would have been better if it had a flat display like the v30. how can i disable the front camera? thats my main problem. i cant stick something on it can i? marker pen? too bad it is an infinityo eventhough it looks better. i can block the camera more easily when it is placed on the head im paranoid.
i am using s10+ bought recently... i have an issue. my mate 10 pro supports dual band 5ghz. and even my ipad pro 13inch does... but my s10+ 5ghz is not showing in my wifi.. my router is xiaomi ac 1200 dual band router. pls somebody help
you guys who are dissing this phone have no idea what your talking about its an absolute gorgeous beast. use one before commenting 
it is beast.
httpsyoutu.befk_ktglkxq4  samsung needs to trim down there software even pixel 3xl with 4 gig of ram manage to beat s10 plus with 8 gig of ram cã‚â€™mon samsung you have powerful hardware trim down some of uslues features and bloatwaer.
its correctly said that some phones are made with large display but with a poor battery capacity !! i dont know whats these phone companies designer or researchers job !! what they do ? sitting idle and gossiping ?? not even think how an user can feel more comfort and use their phone with convenience. shame for them. should immediately sack all rd heads!! 
non removable batteries are not evolution but devolution because non removable batterie are difficult to change when expired
great! 
what is this dynamic oled thing? its just a name gymmick right? not actual tech and its still the same previous oled with a cuthole right? and still will get burned right?
this phone is for gamer and 2 people who want to keep a phone for a very very long time like me. very2 satisfied with this phone. coming from s9+. battery lasts very long. pin hole camera not an issue u get used to it. better than a notch. u get bigger screen at 6.4 this is note size last year. 8 giggs of ram more than enough. performance is very2 fast. stereo speakers sound better than s9+ which is surprising. also get vapour chamber cooling so thats a plus no pun intended for me as i game a lot. runs game at 1080p really cool. weight is lighter also good not burdening your pocket pants. cons are certain games will run with black bar on the camera. but this can be fixed by the app developer. also 219 phones by sony coming out soon but they still lose out on wireless charging n battery size 3300mah. also wireless charging on this phone is super fast. also con is now usb port is build together with the motherboard not separate like the s9 so take care of your port dont use it often. also glass is thinner because of sonic sensor. and not durable because of camera hole so take care. never use this device without a case n tempered glass. overall high recommendation from me. if u can get it get it. 
samsung s10 face unlock has apparently been defeated by photos and video clips. a prominent developer even reported that she was able to unlock her brothers s10.  how can a smartphone which costs more than 800 dollar cannot differentiate between a male and a female? 
every new flagship phone they say batter cpu and power use but it turns out they lie s9 and s9+ sucks and also for s10e and s10 and s10p they all suck they hardly last a day they force you to buy an idiot size phone like note 9 or iphone xs max etc yet they are not cheap. why phone makers just dont care about people that want great battery life and noraml size phone good fit in hand with 3.5m jack anymore.
can anyone confirm the release date of samsung s10+ in japan? cant find it in samsung japan website... and does anyone know which verzion will come out exynos or snapdragon?
samsung needs to  size up  the phone  like  galaxy  note 3
s10+ has infinite contrast ratio = best display ever!
4100mah battery is just a number on the paper. charged my phone fully 10 to 100. 9pm charge is 100..data off aod off recent apps cleared. dint  even touched my mobile. morning 6am charge down to 91. what a shame. even the small companies has better battery management.  if you are a normal to heavy user. u need to charge it twice a day
plastic ceramic stainless steel or aluminum body? which among these is the best? help me choose. haha
loli doubt this one sales is goodfor sure it will not sell well. fake news all over gsmarena. omg. provide a reliable source of this hot selling mobile. i own a samsung deviceand i hate what happend to the device it self. 
what is more better version snapdragon or qualcomm?
does anyone knows which country sells the qualcomm version in asia?
can anyone explain what is instagram mode of galaxy s10
httpswww.xdadevelopers.comsamsunggalaxys1â­0teardownufs21storagegalaxyfoldufs30  samsung lie that there s10s comes with fastest storage of any android phone around it doesnã‚â€™t only if you can offer 2000 for galaxy foldable what a shame.
just got my samsung galaxy s10+ and it has some abnormal heating issues. 
worst selfie camera ever seen in a smartphone..rest all the things are good. even samsung midrangers have better selfie camera than s 10 plus. painted selfies are seen
s10 pulse best mobile in current  best battery life  best touch  best display  best back camera  best face lock  best looking  worlds fist power wireless banking mobile 
the best phone ever.
once upon a time people used to get a refund if they had two or more burned pixels on their screens... nowadays you pay extra to have a massive hole on your screen and you call it innovation????? am i missing something here
i have used samsung phones from s3 to note 9 all s series and note series. finally samsung you have lost one regular customer just because of the pin hole camera. i need full screen without notch or pin and led indicator. if it appears on s11 then i will come back to samsung phones or else good bye.
battery  drains too fast
samsung s10+ ceramic is very nice and  good. never buy a huawei phones huawei cipies technic of apple and other companies in america and in europe. samsung good job....and goodluck in the future. im very satisfied about samsung s10+ ceramic
samsung the best phone in the world
huawei devices arent anywhere close to samsung in quality ui software cameras features or prestige. one area huawei does lead in is the number of trolls attempting to convince others how great their crappy phones are and why everyone should buy one.
no led light for charging status like s8 s9
should i buy samsung galaxy s10+ or waiting for samsung galaxy s10 5g version because of world will have 5g in 2020
great team work  brilliant idea  technology !! superb phone..... samsung is rocking
its a great phone if they only use 1 chipset snapdragon..at my country they give us use exynos. exynos gpu is almost same kirin gpu by huawei. its only different 1 point. bfore this im a samsung users. but now im a huawei users. u can get a cheap phone with a high specs  good chipgpucpu. im done buying samsung phone at my country. 
for me this phone look so elegant and look so modern ..it not should has any issue about duplicate or copy from another product . love this phone cause of a screen and storage 1tb love it so much..keep it up samsung!
fantastic phone
uhrmm samsung creates the displays of apple.
front camera flash light available? 
samsung user here i hate the s10 for that ugly dead pixels on the screen. currently using note 9 and huawei honor play as device. but seriously? mate 20 comments on s10+? my god use samsung device first before bashing it. s10+ is also over expensive. they learned a lot from the past how to maximize the profit. but this time i will say no to phones over 1000 bucks. if note 9 is this expensive i will shift to a cheaper mobile with a tag og 600800. 1000 is too much to handle. 
i fully tested this phone at a best buy today  trying to see if there is any possibility of going back to android or to samsung from iphone xs max.  it still has slight samsung interface lag just like my galaxy note 8 had.  donã‚â€™t get me wrong  itã‚â€™s one of the best top android phones  but after using iphone xs max for over 5 months i donã‚â€™t see myself going back not only to samsung but to android in general.  the only reason i didnã‚â€™t use iphone before this year is because of a small screen.  ios is definitely cleaner and smoother than android. i now see why so many people kept iphone despite iphone always having small screen and slow web page loading not anymore of course. 
did anyone see the big failure in picture quality with the s10x phones? please see here and go with the marker window over the 10 pounds bill.httpswww.gsmarena.compiccmp.php3?idtype=5amâ­pidphone1=9535idphone2=7945idphone3=8â­505 
no
beautiful phone
is it support 5g network in india
disappointing!  still using 12mp cameras.  omg and its a samsung flagship phone.  time to make a jump to huawei....
its great phone
s10 is the future phone.
phone is great
this year samsung played catch up to huawei lets be honest the mate 20 pro is best phone you can buy and samsung copied them with reverse charge and more cameras. the s10 is not worthy upgrade to me.
im looking for the s10+ with snapdragon version and duel sim  can anyone tell the name of this version.
samsung is the best ever .......in the flagship range.......
prism green or prism white what do you think is better and why? 
beautiful phone cant wait to pick my s10+ up on friday.... traded in my note 9 the s10+ just looks perfect
i am gonna switch my iphone xs max for this.  i think samsung make something special with s10+.  last year s9 is not interesting. 
i was not a samsung user and i hated it because of the performance lag it shows after a few months but now they are changed a lot except for the updates. but after seeing and feeling this phone and the performance review by our favorite youtubers i preordered my phone. hope it shows the performance......
this phone cpu is fire. too bad i cant afford this phone. i am happy with my s8 plus 128557
"the galaxy s10+ is indeed about as close as weve gotten to an infinity display" .... you not seen oppo find x or vivo nex s then?
with the trade in incentives this phone is almost a no brainer coming from a note 8. not only am i getting an updated features like in display fingerprint reader and a bigger battery its possibly the only way i can update my phone without root to the latest android os. if i were to get this without the trade in id look elsewhere. its a nice looking phone. im hoping google can step up their game and give us a worthy flagship with specs camera which is probably the best still and design
i have seen that the s10 plus will soon have a update which gives it the led notification which is excellent and i admit samsung uk are offering a unbelievable trade in deal if you have say a s9 plus which i do and id get good money and wireless earbuds and only pay â£550 for a s10 plus which is unbelievably good. im soo tempted i admit.... 
some people are saying a lot of bad things for this phone is because they havent seen improvements before in a phone....  . i think they are apple users...  if something is good pretend its bad for them 128514128514 
best phone in the world
does galaxy s10+ have dual frequency gps support? 
it offers the best design and quality of display available on the market. bye..bye.. notch display the infinityo shows highend technology in making the display much better than just cutting edge of the display.
so it seems the exynos chip is once again ineffiecient. the xiamoi mi 9 with a snapdragon 855 3300mah battery and same screen got the same edurance rating. this bodes very well for 855 variants of the s10.
good product
congratulations on buying a brand new s10+ with a dead pixel on the screen out of the box lol. better not to have a camera on the screen instead of convincing myself to like that infinity o display. its like a dead pixel on the screen really. 
no fast battery charging 27w no fast wireless charging 20w nohigh quality quick charge adapter no good quality fast charging cable no infrared port no reasonable priceno quality service.
just curious as to a video ive seen couldve been an article that states they were able to pump out 2 days worth of battery life with regular usage. also any mention about using thirdparty adapters with the phone? i feel that there should be faster options of charging ones phone besides the one that comes with it. 
first of all almost everyone is using the fingerprint scanner wrong and gsmarena is no exception. once you set up your fingerprints you dont have to hard press on the scanner its not the same as the pressure sensitive unlock. all you have to do is a gentle tap on the scanner and the phone will unlock. second how is it possible that the note 9 with the exynos 9810 has a higher battery endurance rating than the s10+ with a bigger battery and a more efficient processor exynos 9820? if thats the case the sd 855 s10+ should have equal battery endurance to the note 9. going from 97 hours to 91 it says 91 hours on the site but 93 hours in the video hours battery endurance doesnt make any sense. i want to see the sd 855 s10+ get reviewed on this site.
what is the difference between super amoled dayanamic amoled display pls help
s10+ accetable battery life s10 poor poor battery life. i wanted s10 now i think weather to accept a bigger phone or a weaker battery
how long does it take to charge this phone from 0 to 100 with original charger comes in the box ?
i think fanboy apple and fanboy samsung always fight in here.why you all not buy both of phone?s10+ and xs max.so u can get plus and minus.128513
i like this phone samsung s10 plus
personally i think samsung has outdone themselves. i think they do a lot of "first" when it comes to phones. this is one of the first ones with wifi 6 one of the first ones with a 4k selfie cam and one of the first ones with a holepunch screen design! i cant wait to record videos with this phone because they really improved the effects and colors of the image to an impressive degree. i wont be waiting for the 5g model though. im just too excited for this one!
when it comes to the performance still the apple iphone xs max is the champ.
samsung s10 plus or samsung note 9???
honestly this phone likely to become the new mainstay. in just about every way its either equal or better then the s9+.
wow
at the moment i dont see better choice than 10+ good camera and battery are huge plus for this phone i will buy it.
if only samsung were on androidone. they could provide a clean stockish ui with some of their proprietary apps instead of the ugly lagware and bixby.
dayanamic display world first display in mobile 
no aptx hd aptx low no dolby display and what about dolby atmos for headphones? one of the reviewers mentioned something about hdr10+ .
anyway samsung  paiy royalty to sony for reverse wireless charging feature..
so samsung  no longer has retina scanner and ambient light sensors on the phone?
in what version came s10+ in europe 1tb or just 128512 gb
there is nothing that justify the price of this phone 1050ã‚â‚¬ is too much for this i remember when samsung fanboys were mocking about the price of iphone xat least it was a big improvement over iphone 8  but when xiaomi made the same phone at half the price no one cares
hi samsung its been a long time all others removed 3.5 jacks so here i come 10+ is mine!
i think its crap phone seriously...
samsung.. still the leader smartphone in the world128525
samsung finally reach perfection.
samsung has been and still is a leader in phone design. while the past two iterations have been disappointing they honed their ui and came out with cameras that are better than the stolen tech used in chinese phones. prove me wrong! china is the world leader in stealing and using it to their advantage. hwaway is the undisputed king of stolen tech.
the specs are just awesome but is s10+ worth buying?dont know...lol
the specs is out of this world!
i need to resist my urge and wait for the note 10
im an iphone user switching to the samsung s10 plus. 
display is great as expected from samsung
well i got a chance to see and play around the s10plus at a store and first impression is build quality excellentaudio very good thru speaker camera not upto the mark way to much flickering in recording videos and photos from both back and front ultra wide mode are darkened and look botched upnormal photos and zoom photos are just ok nothing of an exceptioni dont know but the output doesnt surely look like a flagship devicei guess it needs a major software update to resolve this.i think note9 or s9 plus had better camera output
well done samsung 
if we applied tempered screen guard on s10 plus the finger print senser will work smoothly or not?
wow ..thats ugly 
can anyone tell me please about earbuds supply? i have a pre order usa. so will i receive free earbuds with my s10+ ? or they will ship earbuds later?  anyone here received s10+ yet? thank you.
awesomebravo samsung 
failing to deliver performance once again. it just released and its already lagging behind in benchmarks. besides that 2010 called they want their 12mp back. 1080p960fps is still missing although the xperia phones from last generation can do that even with the last generation of snapdragon socs. can i underline "last generation" even more? where is the bold tool? 128514 the price ramped up significantly but no bonus features were added. some were even substracted like the iris scanner and the notification led. and even with the removed features they couldnt add a 90hz display at the same price. good but at the same time disappointing.
lovely phone  i m gone buy it  s10+ 128gb is sufficient for me. i want good camera quality in it.
2 things stopping me from getting the s10+ is 1bixby button i know i can remap bla bla but i dont like being forced. especially with a dedicated button.  2exynos in indonesia we get the exynos version only the adaptive fast charging is laughable.im sure its nowhere compared to my mate 20 pros super charge...  other than that its good. a typical samsung flagship. 
1050eurothis is cheap price. lol my god samsung 
 photo cons lack of fine detail in most conditions loss of sharpness across the field lack of detail at longer zoom settings ringing in bright light some subject isolation artifacts in bokeh mode video cons luminance noise in all conditions ringing and judder effect in bright light slightly undersaturated colors in low light loss of sharpness and stepping when tracking a subject some exposure instabilities especially in bright light just wondering after all these cons of s10 plus camera how come dxomark manage to rate it 109 for main camera and 97 for front camera?!!.
speaker on the right bottom and the selfie camera on the top right.... u will cry and so disturbing when u gaming and video.. what a shame and failed design big brand samsung! this is a simple knowledge how u dont know that! omg!
why cant samsung make a beautiful phone? just look at the placement of the cameras its disgusting
i already pre ordered mine getting it on monday
still using 15w charging!!! so bright future.
itã‚â€™s time samsung should start offering dual sim phones in north america.
excited for what the note10 has in store. that 1tb12gb combo is sweet!
i m waiting to see people complaining about "burned screen"
i really dont get why people insist of trading in or replacing phones that they have used for only 6 mths or barely a year for the latest flagship and what is more surprising is that the old phones of most of these people are also flagships themselves such as note 9 iphone xs mate 20 pro p20 pro etc. dont get me wrong s10 series looks amazing and promising but the mentality of the average consumer nowadays are extremely flawed and somewhat outrageous. people dont have to keep switching their phones every time a new phone comes out. having the money to do so is one thing but changing phones every year sometimes every 6 mths wtf will have detrimental effects on the environment as more tech waste is produced. smartphones are supposed to last 2~3 years for the average user and even longer for the flagship ones i used iphone 6 plus for 4 years since 2014 before switching to mate 20 nonpro in 2018.  people always want the new fancy features on their phone even if it only has a few minor upgrades. but what they dont realise or sadly dont care is that an increasingly large portion of wastetrash comes out of ewaste electronic waste discarded electronic devices. a lot of essential materials that could have been used in other areas go into the production of smartphones too. detractors may say that the parts of phones that are traded in will be recycled but only a small portion goes into recycling. logically who would want to add a second hand part eg. camera phone back screen etc to a phone that is supposed to be brand new unless its usabilityquality is refined or relatively unchanged? i wouldnt want my brand new phone to be made up of used parts if i use my hard earned cash to purchase it. and so tradedin phones that do not make the cut will be sent to the trash by phone companies its the truth.  therefore im sure these new and futuristic phones such as s10 series are extremely tempting but i urge all of us to change phone not when we want to only if we need to for the sake of our planet. save the earth. 
this time samsung is really going for it with s10+. they have improved overall esp. the camera which is on par with mate 20 pro. i think its the breakthrough samsung fans have been waiting for. 
soo im expected to trade in my s9 plus which has a notification led and a iris scanner for a s10 plus which has neither and when my s10 plus is on the other side of the room with the always on display turned off how am i to know if i have a message waiting? my s9 plus would have its notification light flashing etcsamsung you say this is the future???  more like a tarted up lg g6 which had no notification led and which i did have at one time and the lack of a notification led was a pain at times.  future my arse... 
samsung just launched the phone that ive been waiting for..  better camera features than any other device... expandable storage capacity and whatever you need is all in there..  check out whats coming up next...
but still lose with mate 20pro and p20 pro
this could have been the year i would buy a samsung galaxy s10+ but it wont happen for one little mistake samsung made by copying apple. the middle housing frame bezel i have seen so many people with iphones and the middle frame bezel looks horrible because the chrome color is more reflective and it shows a lot more scratches than any other phones.
even if you compare this to apples highestend phones the s10 lineup still has more to offer for roughly the same price. id still wait for the note 10 since their note phones in general are essentially more wellrounded versions of their galaxy s lineup.
no dual band gps!  ar you kidding me? you can keep it
something doesnt add up with respect to dimensions. according to s10+ specifications its not as tall length as the s9 plus however on samsungs website it displays the devices side by side and the s10+ is noticeably taller. httpswww.samsung.comusmobilegalaxys10comâ­pare?device1=samsunggalaxys92bdevice2â­=samsunggalaxys7edge 
if you take all that things that samsung is what it is  if you take them all  they are mostly developed from galaxy s3 smart stay ect ect. after galaxy s7 edge  samsung made a fuge change in the look by removing home button and after that nothing. now samsung takes away one thing that make him look like what he looks like  notigucation led.... plus they take away iris scan  and for what????? another camera. why dont we all use camera that can call  then everybody is happy right
s10+ power packed device from samsung... but galaxy fold is also  impressive these devices will bring samsungs profit up and up
i saw from 2016 since s7 released the innovation of samsung are overwhelming!. 10 years has pass for s series and right now you can enjoy watch an movie in full display wqhd+ 199 1440x3040 with hdr10 plus and dynamic amoled??! what the hell!.. our eyes seen unbelievable display phone ever see! still leading best out smartphone display and for vr of course!
brilliant job by samsung galaxy s10+ is looks promising
galaxy s10 plus sd 855 price 84k  mi 9 sd 855 price  31k s10 plus totaly waste of money day by day price cut soon that is samsung strategy save money next year purchase new latest device........money is save  3x more money for s10 plus shitttt..........
and it goes like this  i own note 9  and i am disapointed in s10+... so screen is better in some way. cameras  well they are just pushing them untill reaching point where there is no more points to be reached  i personaly dont care about 3 cameras. no notification light. thing that i love about samsung!!!! no major changes in look or something. i mean ......
gonna wait 6 months or so for the prices to go down and ill upgrade my s8+ either to s10+ sony xz4 or note 9. im also planning to get a 400gb sd card from sandisk  
mehhhh
behind the stage sound was so loud but when it uncovered it hasnt that much loud voice.....s10 plus you are not my expectation......10th anniversary should be more fantastic than this......        look like dumbest look ewww.
am i right in thinking that the s10 plus has no notification led and i am disappointed that it doesnt have the iris scanner also and i have the s9 plus 256gb version and i dont feel like this is really worth it to buy right now to be honest but when the price falls which it will do then it could be worth it. 
i will buy the regular s10 or the note 9 the s10+ front camera is too big in my opinion i hate it 
im keep my note9 cos it great phone as i use spen a lots as im deaf to write a note for easy communication..  i wait for note 11 or later..  plenty of time and saving a lots..   i dont like s10 with hole camera that look quite messy..    note9 still great all the way 
finally s10+ is here. but no way to buy s10+ 512 gb without heavy ceramics. samsung are you mad ???? who for the hell needs upcharged heavy back ceramic? such a pointless move. give us 512 gb version and put even plastic better than ceramic on the back. phone needs to be light and more than 12 weight added is plain stupid. now i will not but s10+ before it is available in nonceramic version. crazy apple logic to ripoff customers is among reason why many shifted from iphone to galaxy.  wake up guys i hope no one will buy heavy ceramic s10+.   
this one looking like note 9but more expensive.i think that now is perfect time to get one note 9 and save some moneycause its a great smartphone. also they use the same strategy like apple now offer some crap basic model for 800ã‚â‚¬ and top model is like 2k.
the galaxy s10 support hdr10+ not hdr 10 and he is the firt smartphone who can make video with hdr10+
just dreaming to have this device sobat missqueen!!!!
i think it is gorilla 5 glass at the back!
 everything is good except 15w charging and all other things are too good love this from bangladesh  waiting for atctoto reviw.     
once again samsung leads the league in flagship devices with its s10s10+ lineups and its rapidly pulling away from its only real competitor in the iphone. all things considered build quality features chipset ui software reliability and compatibility it has no peers. being a galaxy user since the s6 reflects brand loyalty but samsung has earned it. with that shared the latest interations arent without annoyances. first being pricing. its now become the most expensive device on the market. samsung is really padding its profits with memory upgrades. the 128 gb s10+ device is priced at 999.99 reasonable i suppose but still a decent stack for a smartphone. jump to 512 gb and its up to 1249.99. at 1 tb its priced at 1699.99. you will get an uptick in ram to 12 gb on the 1 tb device but i seriously doubt there much of a performance improvement over the 8 gb device. iphone is using the same methodology to justify its cost increases as well so samsungs not alone. what bugs me is its almost pure profit for samsung as im pretty sure the actual cost to samsung from 128 gb to 512 gb is likely 20.00 or less. i would suggest if youre considering the s10s10+ take a look at your current memory requirements internal and sd card. personally and i guessing for a majority of users 128 is plenty for internal as you can compensate with higher external memory options. secondly the color schemes arent very impressive on the 128 gb model. once you move up to a 512 or 1tb device the selections are even worse. lastly are the indisplay camera cutouts. obviously its one of the biggest gripes and hopefully samsung will innovate to find a better option at some point in the future. even with these concerns i will likely upgrade from my s9 plus but i wont pull the trigger until some user feedback is in and prices decline.
ufs 3?
specs as expected... now all that left is the real user experience...
s+ should be discontinued because its about the same size as galaxy notes
where is the 8k30fps or 4k150fps samsung new exynos support both 
people just love to hate on anything new. most of the comments below are just hate and toxicity. i see many people are comparing to the mate 20 pro or the iphone xs max. in my opinion i think the s10+ is better than both. display s10+ has the best display on a phone out right now period performance  the snapdragon 855 matches the a12 in geekbench multiscore. and beats it by a huge margin in sustain gpu performancetomsguide. the snapdragon 855 smokes the kirin 980 in basically everything. in display fingerprint sensors the s10 is said to have a considerable faster fingerprint than the mate 20 pro  design  the s10+ is less heavy and more compact than both the mate 20 pro and iphone xs max.  camera  the super wide angle on the s10+ is the absolute best and much superior than the one found on the mate 20 pro. 
do you always have to wake up the phone with the power button to be able to use the fingerprint reader. in de video review i saw this happening. i hope thats not the case?
just cant believe how light this phone is even with a 4100 mah battery. i think this generation is gonna feel great in hand well see. 
i have mate 20 pro. i love samsung  but whats really new here  in display fingerprint  have  ultrawide angle camera  have  4100 mah  have 4200  fast charging  have ultrafast charging 40w  zoom 2x  have 5x  night mode  best in the branch  design  more compact 
it is time for galaxy hole 10. whatever you call... crippled ugly horrible disqusting... well see how effective holes for shamesong.
so what did you wanted to do with 1tb ram on your galaxy s10+ ? d 
the diagonal screen are 6.3 inch with punch hole. 6.44 inch are without punch hole. is the diagonal correct?
it has got a headphone jack woooo
well i thinks it worst no powerfull processor cant even beat the xs maxx a12 bionic chip  plz dont waste ur money better to go with xs 128514
tommorow a beast will be unveiled by samsung their brand new 10th generation of samsung the galaxy s10 series consist of s10e s10 s10+ and s10x which will destroy the competition wink wink apple wink wink huawei.... alongside with those models finally after 6 years the foldable phone another beast from samsung will be also unveiled first time ever at the public with its actual look. sooo hyped for this they are all beasts by specifications battery sizes are ok cameras are perfect headphone jack expandable storage fast charging reverse wielreless charging ultrasonic under display fingerprint sensor tof sensor a big change in terms of design no obstructive cutout atleast for me snapdragon 855 android 9 with one ui 12gb of ram and freaking 1tb with expandable storage. 5g network and many more!  everything seems cool aside from the price. it will be a bit high so i would recommend yall to wait a bit. atleast they include tons of stuff so even paying bit of a high price will be more worth rather than spending more than 1000usd on an iphone or appple product tbh. and yeah note 10 will be even better. 
omg the cameras ixphone cam take better photos even low light xddd rip samsung so bad cant even autofovus 
hahaha nonononooonnono 12gb ram is huuuge gimmick
front facing camera 10mpix 4k 30fps ois 4axis + eis hail samsung samsung the best!!! 
i wonder whats it like to play games on the s10+ the no1 problem is something to do with the front camera like think about it for example how can i click the icon on the top far left of the screen when i want to go to setting and such.i wish samsung could atleast make exactly like the s10 model front facing camera without those ugly black thing around the camera.what do u think guys? sorry for my english
my only  wish is stainless steel frame and gold option.
i love this beast from samsung
i cant wait to see it on stores
waiting for reviewers to say "this is the best phone ever" the same thing they said a few months ago about note 9.
im really torn between getting the note 9 or the s10+ as an upgrade from the nexus 6p. ive never owned a note so i dont know what it would be like to miss having the spen but isnt it better to know you have the pen if you need it than needing to use it and not having it? the question i have is how much of a difference the sd 855 will have compared to the sd 845 in terms of speed and battery life in real world use.  second the s10+ will have a 4100 mah battery compared to 4000 mah in the note 9. will there be much difference in the battery life because of the indisplay fingerprint sensor? to me it seems like it would cancel each other out? third the sline phones always have more options with accessories. when i look at whats available for the note 9 and the s9+ the s9+ has better case options. whatever i get im going to keep for the next three years because i cant afford to upgrade every six months. i plan on buying unlocked and using it on tmobile so i want to be as future proofed as possible. opinions?
after sometime the camera is more compared to a spiders eyes. lol
12gb ram  1tb rom ... daeymn!!!!
hi does anyone know if the s10 plus will have the option to increase the time for the slowmo videos i have the s9 plus 128gb version and you can only record slowmo for 14 seconds which i find kind of useless would prefer at least 30 seconds or customizable to the users preference
lol are you really serious samsung about that hole? i bought s9+ because it has no notch and upgraded to note 9 because it doesnt have notch honestly this one is more good design in terms of being ugliest. 
i love itthey should release it quickly.
im not very excited about galaxy s10 plus because there is not 4k resolution 
i am awaiting for samsung galaxy s10+ since i heard about this first time i hope so insha allah this phone will be the best cell phone around the globe... waiting for you samsung galaxy s10+  well come well come well come 
4100mah. im sold. thats all i wanted. samsung have learned their lesson. the s9 plus and note 9 have reasonable battery but any little improvement is a winner for me.
so after this new spec sheet the front camera is not wide disappointed. at least the battery rumour is true now with 4100. sadly its starting ram storage for 1keuro  is like a huawei from last year  ex mate 10 pro for half of price. 
why fm radios will be equiped with usa and canada models only? and when will heard fm samsung that they can make a model having all fmmw sw waves. tks.
looks good except that horrible camera hole in the front i though theres nothing worse than notch and then voila!! more stupid people created this stupid design
i own the galaxy s9 plus and given how much i use the phone and its features i dont intend on switching to the s10s10+. it is not that different from what weve already seen in the phone industry i was expecting a big jump from sammy instead of just a few minor upgrades. i cant say im disappointed but neither am i amazed by this new device.  this new screen however has got some charm although i think it will be very uncomfortable to hold the phone without a case.
am i the only one who sees the same design as note 8 ? and the punch crap hole is even worse than any notch i have seen so far.
i like how they designed the render so the camera cutout blends into the dark shadowy navy top right corner and doesnt look as intrusive as it actually is. imagine the camera in the bottom right corner instead... yeah thats how your phone will actually look like.
best samsung offering...s10 better than iphonexs and huawei mate 20
nothing special. 
fail design v
listen guys the cutout is nothing to worry about. we a hated the ugly notch when the iphone x came out but many got used. same with this. it is a better implementation than any other notch and its not that obstrive. plus knowing what samsung does i can guarantee that there will be a hide cutout option. i just wonder how they will be able to keep the stereo sound because that speaker is really small the front one. i hope the second front facing camera is an ultra wide angle lens one kinda like the pixel 33xl. this device will be a beast in 2019but so will the price  dont ask if this will be better than the iphone or vice versa. infact dont compare both android and ios because both are completely different and it depends on what people like. you cant just tell someone that is keen to using imessage face time or pretty much deep inside that apple ecosystem to swith to android. no way he will do that. and not many do it. yes android especially samsung is ahead in many stuff but apple with the iphones have some great stuff too. ive been always using android and will stick to it because i dont do change that easy plus most of the apps i use on android are not available on ios and customisation? i like to be creative but ios offers none of that. i dont really care if the cpu or gpu is like 60 better than whats offered in most top tier android flagships. its pretty much useless because im not gonna have a 100 use of that power it offers. any high end game i could use it for? maybe gta 5??no thats not out on android... fortnite... well i dont play that so no. 
the design somehow reminds me a lot of my 2 years old lg v20... lol
mali g76 mp12 vs adreno 640   adreno  640 estimate  around 900 gflops might cross a 1 teraflops  mail mp10 in  the huawei  490gflop at 720mhz so about 600 gflops   on the mp12 unless samsung boost the clock speed   like they went from 550 to 700 in the s8 to s9 they had like 20 core s
when this has more storage then your ps4  and ram  i wonder how much 8k camera uses tho 
3rd camera front  rear please ultrawide like pixel 3 had..  also night sight cheers~
the irony when this phones ram is more than what your computer has.
the punchhole is very ugly 
its 4000mah 
if it comes with ufs 3.0 and 5000mah its no brainer.
amazing design the front is stunning back is ugly as fu maybe samsung needs to put a glass to cover three lenses because them looks too ugly. 
samsung galaxy s10 series price has high. 
i hope the phone can be updated to android q by the end of the year.
this has 12 gb ram phones dont even have that much storage  how will someone fill 12 ram ram up on thry phone  running 100 apps at once
the prices are ridiculous  1000 plus dollars for a phone is stupid same as iphones  yet people buy them  lol i give up 
one word for the s10 plus is ugliest punch hole dual front facing camera
too much cost and no dedicated memory card slot with dual sim. no thanks samsung. bye bye
is it me or does the rear image of this that has just leaked make it look like there is going to be a headphone jack? 
the 3rd "unannounced camera" is a wide angle lens the same fov as a gopro according to a samsung rep.
the price seems to be way too low..it shouldve been at least 2000 euro for the sake of justice
s10+ comes with dual front camera  worlds first smartphone with 10mp dualpixel camera and 8mp depth sensor on front

1 tb and yet still a microsd card available.. wow. just . wow
1 tb ?????
if this specs are true on top of the line s10+ the note 10 is going to be a server ?
still better and cheaper than apple. but nowhere as price effective as mi9 will be  and i am sure it will be very similar to s10+ but for half the price.
samsung you should give 5000 mah battery for 2019 flagship.
comparing the price with other phones this is still cheap. thank you samsung.
the device is overpriced 1200 usd especially without 5g. likely close to 1500 usd with higher capacity internal memory. sorry sams
why not samsung build a larger battery like lg or other chinese mobiles.. thats critical for flagships..
is that a phone or what? even my laptop has only 4gb ram lol.
when samsung will improve their front camera?
at camera section thy said it will be a wide one a telephoto and the dual aperture one not as you are stating the dual aperture has wide. so third camera is the wide one. but very curious on the front second one probably similar wide.
such a great model is s10+ i wish that the price not come soon to lower for one year because i buy s9 for 800ã‚â‚¬ and after 5 mounths its 490ã‚â‚¬ so please dont let the price lower soon 
not bad 
samsung make s10 active globally and this phone has curved screen which very bad when u drop phone and not comfortable watching like flat screen.
looks like the front facing camera is a dual setup.
only 12mp camera in times when huawei has 48mp camera.. hmmm?
seems good but still 8 mp selfie camera? its the same since s4 i think also that camera hole is terrible id prefer notch but not iphone xs one. its good to have fm radio back! i dont use it too much but its handy anyway and battery saver
i do not like the small capacity of gb ram i think that in all versions should be 12 gb ram. i hope that samsung will finally eliminate the piling of the phone and protect the phone from drawing and breaking. i thought samsung would put on sensors.
wont be upgrading to non of these s10s from my note 9 or even note 10 this year  because all those phones are yet the same with little upgrades keeping up with technology can be very draining and expensive i will wait for the note 11 or so right now the note 9 is enough for me still  i care for my stuff so they last me a long time 
what a crap!!! are they crazy?! people should be stupid to pay like this for a cellphone to check their email  fb or insta!!! for what?! now samsung becam crazy exactly like apple!!! their stuck will drop down exactly like apple!!!
thanks god finally normal phones ! now apple better move into recicling busines. recicling old iphones. 
samsung disappoint me. no dedicated memory card slot.
im definitely upgrading my s8+ for this or sony xz4 in half a year or so when the price drops  
over over over overpriced phone
i fell like i am looking iphone 7 plus from back side. front camera design will kill s10 plus market.....
hmmm may be go to the apple or huawei product if the price like that
so none of new s10 models will come with 5g and then with exynos.... ?! where the price coming from then if they produce all the components?!
ooh no again hybrid dual sim. i not like this
its not all in megapixels.
sos tupid to add 1tb or 512 gb you cant load all the memory. becasue next year will come s11+ useles memorie. maxim for a phone is 64gb maxim! also 128gb is to much.
12mp again
i bet 12gb ram and 1tb will cost around 2000.  genuinely same phone made by xiaomi with xiaomi sticker on it would cost up to 700. what that means? supporting samsung = supporting den of thieves. 
look nice but dont like the camera on the screen..    so i wait for note 11 next year as note 9 still great phone  
it cant be for them to use again the old 12 mp sensor. by the way the mp race has started to rise again. 12 mp will be considered midend only soon. that 12 gb of ram is insane by the way! 
quick charge 2.0
lets hope that it will be holistically great this time!!!?
